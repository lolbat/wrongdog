## Automation

### Alfred

{{< toolicon Alfred.png >}}[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) is my new favourite automation app. It is also a file/application launcher but I really think of it primarily as an automation tool. Unlike other tools that focus on being scripting or development environment, Alfred is the unix pipe command in a visual form. It lets you build workflows by connecting them or, if you want, to write your own scripts and then connect them to other actions and apps more easily. 

### Keyboard Maestro

{{< toolicon keyboardmaestro-128.png >}}[Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) is the 'old man' of the Mac automation world and where its UI might be a bit dated it makes up for that with variety and sheer power. It can be triggered in a staggering number of ways and has been on the scene so long that most other automation apps work with it. I have a menu full of macros that I use in Nota to let me use [CriticMarkup](https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit) and also process files from clients with known text practices that I always have to correct.

### Script Debugger

{{< toolicon ScriptDebugger.png >}}[Late Night Software](https://latenightsw.com) produces Script Debugger 8 which is the best tool to use if you need to write any AppleScript code. The current version of Script Debugger has a 20 day trial period and then falls back into a Lite mode (similar to BBEdit). It has been developed for more than twenty years and has almost every conceivable AppleScript tool in it that you could need. 

### Hazel

{{< toolicon Hazel.png >}}[Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com) is a recent addition to my application lineup but it has become essential. It keeps my Download folder tidy and it helps me create rules to handle odd cases where I need to run scripts before or after processing files. 
 
## Coding

### Nova

{{< toolicon nova-app-icon.png >}}[Nova](https://nova.app) is my favourite Mac IDE and an extension and expansion of the Coda IDE. The primary reason that I love it (and loved Coda) is that it is a Mac app through and through. It also has handled every development task that I have ever thrown at it. 

### RunJS

{{< toolicon RunJS.jpg >}}[RunJS](https://runjs.app) is a JavaScript "playground" that lets you test out JavaScript commands, functions loops etc and make sure that your code does what it is supposed to. It has made working with text and Node significantly easier. 

### Easy CSV

{{< toolicon EasyCSV.png >}}Some time ago I decided that unless it was necessary I was going to stop using spreadsheets and just work with `.csv` files. I have done a significant amount of work with raw data files and `.csv` is easier to work with and more portable. I tried a significant number of apps and [Easy CSV ](https://vdt-labs.com/easy-csv-editor/) is not only the best but has great features like Markdown and JSON export and merge and split tools. It also has a command line tool and is scriptable. 

### BBEdit

{{< toolicon app_icon-14-512.png >}}I think that [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) has been around as long as I have been using a Mac. Sometimes there are find & replace or text processing tasks that are too much for other apps. But never too difficult for BBEdit. Bare Bones used to offer a free app, TextWrangler, that had a subset of the BBEdit tools but they now offer the same features inside BBEdit. It runs in full mode for a limited trial and then reverts to Lite mode. 

### CodeKit

{{< toolicon CodeKit.jpg >}}[CodeKit](https://codekitapp.com) is an application that gives you GUI access to a huge number of command line web development tools. Sass, TypeScript, Pug, Babel. A whole list of technologies that I wouldn't really use if it wasn't for the ease with which I can access them in CodeKit. It also comes with its own templating system that makes it simple to build your site from smaller parts without having to learn a complicated command line syntax.

## Writing

### Nota

{{< toolicon nota.png >}}[Nota](https://nota.md) is a great tool to use for writing in Markdown. I am using it only because Ulysses has an issue with YAML frontmatter. As soon as that is fixed I will be saying goodbye to Nota. It is an Electron app but the developers have made great strides to make it more Mac-like. The UI is a bit goofy but whatever its failings I keep coming back to it. 

### Marked 2

{{< toolicon marked.png >}}[Marked 2](https://marked2app.com) is advertised as a Markdown preview app but that is a gloss of its full features. It is scriptable, can use custom pre and post processing, can be used to merge multiple files and understands CriticMarkup and can be used to read the output from PostDiff to build documents that show changes based on it. It is a central element of any Markdown editing and writing workflow you would want to build. 

## Utilities

### CleanShot X

{{< toolicon logo.png >}}[CleanShot X](https://cleanshot.com) is a gift to anyone who uses and edits screenshots. It has annotation and editing tools. OCR. It can capture scrolling section so you can create screenshots of large screen areas. And the new background tool make it a breeze to create vibrant screenshots. It is simple to use and very easy to slip into your workflow.

### iTerm 2

{{< toolicon iTerm2.jpeg >}}I have, over the past few years, spent more time using shell command and scripts than I have ever previously done. [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com/index.html) has made all of that work much easier.  Split panes. Tabs. Search. Autocomplete. Paste history. Just so many things

### Tot

{{< toolicon tot_tout.png >}}[Tot](https://tot.rocks) is an odd app that you don't really know you are going to like until you use it. It stores text. It has multiple places to store text and that is really all it does. It has Shortcuts support that can be used to male it  send and retrieve text. It is just immeasurably handy. 

## Other

### Acorn

{{< toolicon acorn_256x256.png >}}I haven't had the need for an image editing application on the scale of Photoshop for some time. I do edit a lot of different types of images and often have need to create some complex, layered documents and when I do I have [Acorn](https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/). It has layers, filters, brushes, multiple masking modes, shape tools, bezier curves and text on a path. It has all of the critical elements I would use in Photoshop in a smaller, faster app. And it is a great looking Mac app as well. And it is scriptable and lets you write your own JavaScript or AppleScript code for macros. 

### Retrobatch

{{< toolicon retrobatch_256x256.png >}}[Retrobatch](https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/) is a batch editing utility by the fine folks that make Acorn. I don't often have need for it but when I do it works quickly and efficiently. It is scriptable and you can write custom code in JavaScript if you need to add new functions. 

### MailMate

{{< toolicon MailMate_1024.png >}}I don't send or receive anywhere near as much email as I used to but I really only want one thing in an email client - [Claris Emailer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claris_Emailer). And since I am never going to be getting it back, the best replacement is [MailMate](https://freron.com). It has bottom quoting, it automatically blocks an immense number of tracking pixels and code and it will default to text formatting for incoming and outgoing mail. Did I mention bottom quoting?

### Reeder 5

{{< toolicon reeder.png >}}As with email, I don't follow as many RSS feeds as I used to but when I do I want the feeds, and the app, to look good. [Reeder 5](https://reederapp.com) looks very good. It is easy to use, easy to read and it will subscribe to Mastodon RSS feeds. It makes viewing and using RSS a breeze.
