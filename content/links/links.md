Back in the age of dinosaurs, or virtual dinosaurs in any case, there were no search engines and so if you wanted to find interesting content you needed to visit a web page that you liked and then see if they had any interesting links. Or someone would email you a URL or scrawl it on the back of a bar napkin. There were usually exclamation points involved.

The sites that eventually turned into search engines, like Yahoo, originally started out with multiple pages of links to fun websites or pages organised by content type. Search engines are a mess and will, with the advent of ChatGPT generated SEO content driven websites, get even worse. So it may be a good idea to resurrect the idea of a links page so when you find a blog that has interesting content, probably not this one, you can check out their links page and see what websites they read and check out.
