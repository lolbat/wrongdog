The first result for [it's not the band I hate, it's their fans](https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=its%20not%20the%20band%20I%20hate%20its%20their%20fans) on Ecosia leads to [an old article from  the GigCity website](https://www.gigcity.ca/2013/09/26/music-preview-its-not-the-band-i-hate-its-their-fans/) [^1] about an upcoming Sloan show. I am thinking about Sloan because I am using their song _Coax Me_ to test out several equalizer applications on my Mac and I am using the studio and live versions of _Coax Me_ to test the software out. I haven't settled on any one piece of software but I am leaning towards using [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/) from Rogue Amoeba Software. It does a better job with sound settings between my Mac and my, rather pedestrian, headphones. 

I am currently using [Doppler](https://brushedtype.co/doppler/) from Brushed Type. Their website brands Doppler as "built for people who buy music" and I think I understand what they mean by that. Some time ago I read an article about how the use cases for Apple Music listeners informed the design of the application. One group, streamers, had a much different set of requirements from people who had their music on their computers and wanted to build their own playlists and move them to and from other devices.

## Wither Music?

Apple picked the streamers and the iTunes/Music experience for those folks who buy their music has been getting worse each new iteration of the application [^2]. If you download Doppler and start using it you will be struck by how much the interface resembles an older version of Music.  This may worry you if you have had poor interactions with the Apple Music app in the past but Doppler does indeed seem to be "built for people who buy music" and it has none of the annoyances that plague Music [^3]. 

I spent the last few months using Apple Music to listen to as much Jazz as I possibly could. The experience of using the Music app was a constant struggle. It never seemed to want to do anything sensible and most of the things it did annoyed the hell out of me. [Cog](https://cog.losno.co/), another Mac music player, recognises then you are listening to an album and when it comes to the end it stops playing. Music randomly starts playing songs that it thinks are related to what you were listening to. Coltrane is just like Ahmad Jamal, right? Eventually the convenience of having access to that much music was outdone by the persistent shittiness of the Music application. 

## Fancy plans and pants to match

I really do like listening to music. Especially when I work or when I take the dog out for a walk. The Apple Music app makes me think wistfully back to WinAmp. Music has got to go and it will most likely be replaced by Doppler. Not that Doppler does anything magical. It just plays my music. In the long term the basement office will be getting a bluetooth turntable and I will be investing in some vinyl. 

If the turntable works out then I suspect it will be followed, at some point, by an amp and some speakers. For the moment I will use my existing Bluetooth speaker while I see how the turntable works out. I will also be buying some albums in FLAC format and possibly reripping my CDs if I can find a good application to do it. 

I just want to listen to my music. I don't want to "discover" anything. I don't want to stream 4 hours of top 100 tunes. Just music. 

## Footnotes

[^1]: It also describes the Sloan song _Underwhelmed_ as "the Canadian answer to Smells Like Teen Spirit" which I rather like.

[^2]: All of my partner's "iPhone" complaints have always been about iTunes and Music. Not iOS.

[^3]: My current favourite is Music telling me that it will remove a song from my Library because I removed it from a playlist. Who writes software like that?
