Genre fiction is an interesting field. Unless you are a fan of the Warhammer 40,000 game you are probably not familiar with the [Horus Heresy book series](https://www.blacklibrary.com/the-horus-heresy) that has been published by Games Workshop through their Black Library imprint. It is a [54 book series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Horus_Heresy) [^1] that is being capped off with another series of novels titled *The Siege of Terra*. This second series culminates in a trilogy of books by Dan Abnett titled *The End and the Death*. 

The Horus Heresy is an in-world event that [was first mentioned](https://www.warhammer-community.com/2022/05/20/horus-heresy-history-the-evolution-of-the-age-of-darkness/) in the *Adeptus Titanicus* game in 1988. And even then it was only given enough column inches, by game developer [Jervis Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jervis_Johnson),  to explain why the game had two different, identical, forces of Space Marines fighting each other. 

> *Ten thousand years ago, when the Imperium was young and the Emperor walked among men, rebellion flared. The Imperium was split and Mankind teetered on the edge of disaster. Anew age, one ruled by the forces of Chaos, began in civil war and with acts of desperation and brutality.*
>
> *General Horus was regarded as the finest military commander of his age. When brave deeds were common. he was exceptional, and the Emperor eventually honoured him with the title of Imperial Warmaster, second only to the Emperor himself. Yet at the height of his powers, Horus, the hero who could do no wrong, turned against his Emperor. On the feral world of Davin, the Warmaster was possessed by a Daemon from the warp.*
>
> *With a tool such as Horus, the servants of Chaos planned to destroy the Imperium and install their own puppet Emperor. Darkness would be unchecked and universally triumphant. The daemonic Horus, still respected and loved by his troops, plotted and conspired; all his skill was bent towards the destruction of the Imperium and his Emperor. The plot was eventually exposed, and thus began the First Inter-Legionary War.*

Games Workshop also released two expansions for their Warhammer 40,000/Fantasy Battle  games called [Slaves to Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realm_of_Chaos:_Slaves_to_Darkness) and *Lost and the Damned* that added additional information about the Horus Heresy. At this point Horus was still a general but the main elements of the story were fleshed out. 

[Dan Abnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Abnett) is a British writer of fiction and comic books. He started out writing for 2000 AD and went on to write books for Marvel and DC including two great runs writing the [Legion of Super-heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Super-Heroes). Abnett's first prose work [^2] for Games Workshop were the books in the [Gaunt's Ghost series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaunt%27s_Ghosts) of military sci-fi set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. He has put [a considerable number of words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Abnett_bibliography) on the page.

*The End and the Death*
