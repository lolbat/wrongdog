description: Why do I keep not seeing announcements for new games and hobby products that I would be interested in? Has the internet really become that concentrated? And how do small publishers reach those of use in the hinterlands of the internet?

A few days ago I met up with a fellow boardgamer in the city to purchase a copy of a boardgame from them. It is called [Dark Venture: Battle of the Ancients](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/298163/dark-venture-battle-of-the-ancients) and it is pretty much exactly the type of thing that I like. Which got me thinking, how did I not see this when it was announced?

The answer is, I think you will agree, the silo effect of social media. I have a Facebook account [^1] but it is used primarily to keep tabs on a few local buy-and-sell groups. Facebook Marketplace killed any other source for used hobby products. I am not on X and I had given up on Twitter some time before its sale to Elon Musk. I didn't join Bluesky [^2] and Threads will just end up like Facebook if it already isn't.

I have been enjoying my time on Mastodon but the number of small publishers that are using the service is quite small. Or maybe it is larger? Discoverability is, as people are fond of saying, is a problem on Mastodon. That said, it also makes it more difficult for fascists, reply-guys and shitheads to find you. 

My self-imposed exile from the downtown of social media sites means that I have missed what would have been interesting announcements. And it will continue to be the case as long as small publishers continue to maintain their marketing efforts on a few social media sites. [Guilded Skull Games](https://gildedskull.com/), the developer of Battle of the Ancients has a presence on Facebook and X. The owner (and sole employee of the company) also hangs out on [BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/). Since I don't use Facebook to find news and I am not on X, I will really only see anything about their games if I see a post on BGG. BoardGameGeek is great for a lot of things but 'discoverability' is not really its forte. 

Discoverability is at the core of marketing for small publishers. Facebook and Twitter might have been good places for people to find your wares in the past but the changes in their business models have made that a thing of the past. I have talked, [in the past](https://whatiswrongwithyourdog.netlify.app/posts/posse/), about using your own website as a source of  syndication content. This is even more important for small publishers as it is for bloggers or writers.
