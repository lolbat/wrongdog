I have been using the iPad since it was originally released. When finally received mine it was a revolutionary device that changed how I interacted with the web, movies, games and, eventually, books. Developers came out with great apps and games. The device got faster, lighter and more powerful. And then things started to go wrong.

In the last few years I have felt that I am not using my iPad as much as working around the flaws in the device and the OS. It is less enjoyable and Apple doesn't really seem to be interested in making the iPad better but just bumping the tech specs each cycle to push new sales.

## Typing

While it isn't a new problem, writing on an iPad is an utter PITA and hasn't made any meaningful strides in the last few years. I do all of my writing on the iPad using the virtual keyboard. If I want to use a real keyboard I will just grab my laptop instead. The idea of having a distinct keyboard for my iPad seems retrograde. Not only do you type in a different physical posture but the device was intended to be used with a keyboard. The virtual keyboard isn't accurate, it is next to impossible to accurately move the cursor and selecting text is also a misery. Apple seems to have given up on fixing typing and editing on the iPad.

## Its not a computer

Apple seems to not really have made its mind up whether the iPad is a device to interact with the web and content or a smaller laptop. You can see this in the half-assed manner in which it approaches multitasking and window management on the iPad. Not, mind you, that the Mac really shines in terms of window management. You can add a keyboard and even an external monitor but both processes are buggy as hell.

So Apple spends time adding "desktop" features to the device and manages to half-ass those while, at the same time, not making the device any easier to use as a tablet.

## Games

Apple has supposedly been trying to get more game developers to produce games for the Mac, and then the iPad, for decades. One area that they have had wild success is in creating a marketplace on iOS that is full of freemium crapware games like Clash of the Clans. Apple still doesn't allow developers to charge for application updates but they did open the floodgates for games (and sometimes apps) that charge ridiculous amounts of money for gems, coins, hearts or some other virtual currency. For a small period of time the iPad was actually getting decent, and sometimes unique, games but that all came crashing to a halt once Apple made it possible for someone with more money than sense to pay $99 for some coins that let them open a chest quicker.

We even now have games like [Kingdom Rush](https://www.kingdomrush.com/) that are premium (not free) but still include IAP to unlock new heroes. [Kingdom Rush Vengance](https://www.kingdomrushvengeance.com/) is available as a standalone game with a large number of IAP or as part of the Apple Arcade subscription. The Apple Arcade version has no IAP and you unlock new heroes the old fashioned way by beating the game and progressing through the levels. I suspect that developers like [Ironhide Game Studio](https://www.ironhidegames.com/) would probably not want to include IAP in their titles but Apple has allowed the marketplace for iOS games devolve to the point where it isn't possible.
