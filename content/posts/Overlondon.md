{{< alignimg OverLondon.jpg left>}}I used to read quite a lot of books. This was in the bygone days before there were children, pets and a household to look after. I took a considerable hiatus from recreational reading but now that the kids are capable of taking care of themselves I find that I have more free time to spend as I would like. 

Most of my recent reading has been scattershot in nature. Nonfiction books about finance, Sherlock Holmes Mythos novels and the odd title about crosswords or puzzles. Since I joined Mastodon I have seen quite a few titles that have interested me but not many that I have sat down to read. 

I recently followed an author, [George Penney](https://sunny.garden/@georgepenney), who was looking for folks to read and review their upcoming novel titled [OverLondon](https://www.overlondon.net/). The [description of the novel](https://www.overlondon.net/overlondon) sounded quite mad [^1] and also quite unlike anything I normally read. So I signed up and started to give it a read.

_**Important caveat**: I have not finished the novel and so these comments are based on an incomplete picture of the story and how it concludes._ 

## Would Mr. Pratchett please pick up the white courtesy phone

The book's writing, and setting, is highly reminiscent of Terry Pratchett just without the footnotes [^2]. I don't mean that as a critique. Penney and Johnson have managed to summon forth the same joy of japes and wordplay, combined with social satire, without aping Pratchett's style. The comparison to Discworld would be unavoidable in any sense since OverLondon is a comedy novel in a fantasy setting that takes the odd dig at modern culture. So if you are going to get tarred with that brush anyway why not go all in?

Their humour is, at times, quite sharp and they have no problem adding in classes of people, like the aristocracy, for whom they clearly have no love and serve as the butt of some great humour. Some of the best lines in the book so far and a wonderful blend of Pratchett and [a younger Eddie Izzard](http://www.auntiemomo.com/cakeordeath/d2ktranscription.html#churchofengland) [^3].

## More than meets the eye

The world of OverLondon is baroque in period as well as detail. It is a mad conglomeration of steampunk and Tudor politics with the addition of what you would think are anthropomorphic animals but are really people with animal-like personality or physical quirks. I have to say that was a great relief for me. Characters with kawaii ears or tails are really beyond the pale for me. 

OverLondon is complex polity and the authors don't ease you into it. The references come at you in a blur but it is only a short time before you are comfortable with them. I much prefer when an author does this as it makes the characters seem more three-dimensional. 

There are quite a few concurrent events going on in OverLondon that you can start to see will come together is a massive, and probably explosive, conclusion. It has been quite a lot of fun seeing them begin to be threaded together. Penney and Johnson [^4] go a commendable job keeping you informed of the various plots and going-ons without overwhelming you. 

## Not quite a conclusion

I am, at the moment of writing this post, about a third of a way through the book. I am really quite excited to see how it ends and also eminently worried about getting to the conclusion since the world, and the characters, have been a lot of fun so far and I really won't be able to stand the wait for a new book. 

The book is [available for pre-order](https://books2read.com/OverLondon) and you can also [check out the first chapter](https://www.overlondon.net/post/chapter-one-of-overlondon-just-for-you) if you are so inclined.
