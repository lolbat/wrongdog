The Python channel on Mastodon [posted a link to a video](https://curbal.social/@python/110106539718637237) about projects that you could use to inspire yourself while you try to learn Python. This was an interesting co-incidence since I was talking to one of the twins about this very thing this morning. They are learning Python because their favourite game uses it as the language to build mods. I am learning it because it seemed like a good idea. 

Whenever I start to learn a new programming language I typically try to build apps or tools for myself. When I was learning Visual Basic I wrote a map launcher and tracker for Quake. When I was learning Cross/Realbasic I built some tools to convert emails that that URL encoding in them from form submissions [^1].

With Python I have done a few standard tutorials but I then moved off into building tools that I can use for my own work. Currently I am building a command line tool to preflight my Hugo posts. I tend to forget to update the `date` in then and also forget to set the `draft` value to false. I doubt that this would be of any real use to anyone else but since it is something that I would use often it keeps me motivated.

Quite a lot of my work recently has been related to Hugo. In fact, learning Python at all was instigated by my desire to add a script to an Alfred Workflow for Hugo. The Python script I am currently working on, may, be rewritten slightly and posted into that Alfred workflow. Did I mention I was writing a Textual app that acted as a simple CMS for Hugo?

I am noticing a pattern develop.
