# On The Trail

Jazz is a form of music that invites investigation and research. Or perhaps it is better to say that if one is inclined to curiously track down references and releases that Jazz contains ample rewards for your work. 

When I was younger I spent a few years listening to old Jazz albums that were being rereleased on CD by Blue Note and other labels. Quite lot of it was songs and albums featuring vocalists. I had a few CDs by artists such as  Art Blakey, Oscar Peterson and Ellis Marsalis but they didn’t get a lot of regular play time. I am not sure why but vocal performances were more appealing to me at the time.

I stopped listening to Jazz, but thankfully kept all of my CDs, and it wasn’t until recently that started listening to Jazz again. This was, as I have written earlier, due to being introduced to a video of Oscar Peterson’s set _Live At Ronnie Scott's 1974_. The music in it is wonderful, the performances are all brilliant and I think that I have bored my family to death talking about it. 

Aside from rekindling my interest in the genre, it also showed me the depth of musical information that was available to plumb. Alternate takes. Different artists covering the same tune. The origin of pieces of music. 

I have, since that time, become something of a fanatic about instrumental Jazz. I find that the music helps to keep my brain focused despite the departures that artists can make from the “standard” interpretation of a piece of music. This is decidedly odd since that exact same thing can ruin a piece of music for me in other genres. A word out of place, a missed note or even a vocal warble can pull me out of my work and make me skip the song [^1]. 

[Richard Littler](https://www.richardlittler.com/), author of the [Scarfolk art project](https://www.richardlittler.com/scarfolk-environs) discussed a link he had found that described how the changes in Jazz music can help to keep neurodivergent people focused. The changes and improvisations in a Jazz tune are typically based on musical progressions and while they might sound divergent they don’t cause the same reaction as a missed note or a change in lyrics. Perhaps it is because they stay inside [a larger musical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths)?

Whatever the reason, my mornings now start with turning on my Bose Bluetooth speaker, opening Apple Music and picking an album to play. Typically on repeat. During one of these morning music sessions I was excited to hear a new version of a piece that I originally found on the _Live at Ronnie Scott’s 1974_ set. That song was _On The Trail_. 

On the Peterson album, as with others, the song is credited to [Ferde Grofé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferde_Grof%C3%A9) an American composer who wrote _On The Trail_ as the third of his five movement [_Grand Canyon Suite_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon_Suite). The entire suite has been performed many times including [a wonderful recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh23R2qK1zA&list=OLAK5uy_m_XCPIcHMQk2leX6jqA3rsoTOjhFbqlrM&index=3) conducted by Leonard Bernstein. If you listen to the Grofé piece though you will be quite confused as it sounds nothing like the music performed by Oscar Peterson and other Jazz artists. 

The first Jazz version of _On The Trail_ is widely attributed to Jimmy Heath. It was the first track on his [1964 album of the same name](https://www.discogs.com/master/638697-Jimmy-Heath-Quintet-Featuring-Kenny-Burrell-And-Wynton-Kelly-On-The-Trail). There are earlier records released with songs of the same name but I have been unable to find digital recordings of them to see if they are the same as the Jimmy Heath work or something else.  




> I got hooked up with the song “On the Trail” by playing with Donald Byrd. He had an arrangement of it and we were supposed to record it for Alfred Lion at Blue Note. Then Alfred and Donald got into a dispute, and Donald walked out of the record date. I said, “Well, I’m gonna record this arrangement.” Everybody thought it was mine, but that was Donald’s arrangement, with a line that comes from (Gabriel Fauré’s) Pavane. Kenny Burrell plays that line on my recording. It wasn’t supposed to be played by a guitar in Donald’s version, so that was probably my idea.

### Footnotes

[^1]: As an example, the band [Staind](https://staindofficial.com/) have a very good cover of _Comfortably Numb_ by Pink Floyd. It is unlike most of the music the band creates and it could possibly be my favourite cover of the song except that the signer mixes up one word in the chorus. If I am paying attention to the song it ruins the experience for me.
