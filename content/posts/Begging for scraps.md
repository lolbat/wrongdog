I am, in a few respects, not the average Mac consumer. I tend to use my hardware until it breaks (I once dropped a Macbook Pro onto a floor and split the case) or it no longer works well for the tasks that I need it. And even then I try to reuse them. The old iMac I used to do Flex (ugh!) and Director programming on is now in the basement running a Plex server for the family and acting as a print server. 

I have replaced one Mac computer before it became unusable and that is because I needed to get a new Mac with a PCI bus to use for a specific graphic card I wanted. I sure don't miss those days. I am not immune to the appeal of a new computer. I think everyone likes fancy, shiny new toys but I am typically hampered by my lack of disposable income and new Macs typically require foldin' money as the kids say. I am not bringing this up to flex for online cred. I am trying to establish that I have only a shallow interest in new Mac hardware but I am damned if I can find Mac related content online that isn't about new hardware. Or AirPods. 
I recently tooted a comment about why the majority of Mac news sites don't post articles about new software releases. What I want to read and know about are typically new apps or to read tips and tricks on how to create new automation systems or get apps to intercommunicate. New Macs and new laptops are interesting but they aren't something I want to read about every day. Or new AirPods. Or watches. Or whatever new thing that Apple is selling that is expensive enough to generate revenue via affiliate links.

## Paying the bills

This focus on content that can lead to affiliate referrals is probably an indication of the inability of tech sites to make money from direct ads. I don't know but I suspect that your average tech site suffers from low clickthrough rates on the ads they get from Google or Facebook. [^1] They also are affected by SEO content farms that will work to show up as high as possible in search results and have content that is good enough to fool Google's systems but not good enough to actually be informative. The SEO farmers are putting out 100s of sites to farm ads which must be driving down the response rates for those same ads. Making it more difficult to use ads to survive.

So what are you to do if you run a site that needs to have viewers who can help pay the bills? Affiliate links appears to be the answer. I am not sure if there was some second idea that sites tried and we just missed it or they just all jumped to affiliate links but here we are. Depending on the product and the system you are using, sites can make quite a lot of money from the fees that affiliate links pay. The Verge, which has a lot of stories with affiliate links, [recently wrote about](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562966/cnet-ai-written-stories-red-ventures-seo-marketing) the woes suffered by C|Net during their recent foofaraw regarding the use of "AI" systems to write financial articles. One interesting part of the article was that C|Net could be making anywhere from $250 - 900 US for credit card signups [^2]. 

Now your average tech site isn't selling credit cards or bank loans (yet) but it is showing you articles for expensive geegaws and one can probably draw the line connecting them without much help. The road to higher profitability  is paved with affiliate links and using them as a revenue stream seems to lead to problems.

## One of these things is exactly like the others

If you go online you will probably be struck by a homogeneity[^3] of content offerings. Articles about new phones, the top ten movies coming to Disney+, the best movies leaving Netflix, new noise-cancelling headphones and the best AirPods to use when telling your BFF that they can't use your Netflix password. I even found myself looking at an article about "[the most famous punch Batmanâ€™s ever thrown](https://www.polygon.com/23569816/batman-best-punch)" wondering why anyone outside of a comic blog would produce it as an article. The reason is, as you may have guessed, because the article includes an Amazon link at the bottom to the Justice League International trade paperback that contains the story. 

So if the road to profitability is through the use of articles that can justify revenue generating affiliate links then what does that mean for the average tech site? Looking at many of them the answer is that it ends up with readers having very little options for content that won't drive revenue. Or in the case of larger sites, like The Verge which has a wider audience range, it means random articles like the one linked above that are only there to draw the attention of a part of the site's demographic and potentially end up with a sale on Amazon [^4].

## In days of yore

I have, over the course of a chaotic career, helped run two content websites that used advertising to pay the bills. This was quite a long time ago and was from a different geological age when it comes to online publishing and ad sales.

The first site was articles and tips for multimedia developers. No not Flash but nearby. When we wanted to try to run ads on the site I had to write my own ad system because none was available for [ColdFusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_ColdFusion) at the time. Doubleclick was around but there was no way I was able to find that would let us use it on the site. We were careful to only display ads from products that our readers would want to see and it all worked quite well. Bills were paid. Advertisers were happy. Readers didn't complain.

The second site focused on tabletop games and while I could have used Google Ads on the site [^5] I followed my instincts and installed the [OpenX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenX_(company)) ad software on my server and ran my own ads from companies that sold products I knew the readers of the site would want to see. It was more work to use OpenX but it also gave my advertisers more features and reports. It was also slightly more secure than my older code.

## Control your own destiny

So if affiliate links lead to a homogenous reading experience and ads don't pay enough then why aren't more sites hosting their own ads and moderating the experience for their readers? Isn't that what magazines did? Hell even I did it twice. 

Running your own ad server has become less of an option for most sites for two reasons. First, most of the money in advertising is in [tracking readers and getting information about them](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10221859). The second is that the industry has formed around a series of standards for ad auctions and metrics that would be difficult for most sites to duplicate or take part in. [This article](https://www.kevel.com/blog/build-ad-server-hidden-costs) from a company that sells a system for ad serving is filled with a lot of self-serving BS but it also does list all of the issues that companies demand from ad systems.

Many companies also don't deal directly with advertisers. They hire media companies to help them place ads in the appropriate sites based on the demographics of the people they want to have see their ads. Those media companies then deal with other companies that auction ads to Google and Facebook. And they sell two friends. And they sell two friends. And so on. 

There is no direct market for ads. There probably only was for a four year span in 1995 before Doubleclick became established. Even before Google's purchase of Doubleclick in 2005, there was no way for a smaller website to manage their own ad sales unless their market was small enough to enable direct communication with companies. It has only gotten worse since then and smaller publishers probably have no options available to them now.

## What a time to be alive

So lets swing this back to my original point before my grade ten English teacher sends me an angry email.

The publishing industry online has been left with few options when it comes to generating enough revenue to keep the lights on and people paid. And these limited options have lead them to a place where they create remarkably similar content, focus on a few high profit areas and sometimes write utterly random pieces to help build affiliate link income from e-commerce sites like Amazon.

It is an ugly situation to be in for everyone involved. Readers don't really get any decent, original content, writers have to regurgitate the same BS about new, expensive products and small businesses can't get their products in front of viewers because they can't pay for the ads or generate enough revenue from affiliate links to their products. If they even exist.

I downloaded a few interesting apps for my Mac this week and the most expensive was $8.99 Cnd and the least expensive was $1.39 Cnd. It took me quite a while to find these apps. None of the tech sites I visited had news or articles about them and online searches for apps that had their features resulted in SEO BS about something similar but not related or products that were out of my budget or for the wrong platform. These developers can't advertise, they can't buy ads on Facebook and Twitter, which was probably their main channel of promotion, is now a far-right cesspool that is hemorrhaging users. 

Most small to medium publishers online are begging for scraps from the same bowl and no-one is "winning" in this situation.  Well maybe Google and Facebook but this is supposed to be the future we are living through, an age of content and information, so why I do I miss magazines so much? 

### Footnotes

[^1]: Try doing a search to find information about this. On the first page of my Duck Duck Go results there was a link to an article about how to make money watching ads online. 

[^2]: Halsey Minor must be kicking himself for not thinking of it. 

[^3]: It is on my word of the day calendar today. 

[^4]: I already have the trade paperback so I didn't click on the link to buy it. It is a good series though and you should go to your local comic store to see if they have it. Go for a walk, get a drink on the way there and make an afternoon of it. 

[^5]: I did actually use AdSense ads for a three day period. I stopped because my readers sent me angry emails wondering why they were seeing ads against [California's Proposition 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_California_Proposition_8). I killed the ads immediately and wondered how it was that a site that had such a focused set of content could get political ads served to it.
