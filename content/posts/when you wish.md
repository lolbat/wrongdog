_Star light, star bright,\
First star I see tonight;\
I wish I may, I wish I might\
Know if you are a Starlink satellite_

2022 has been a year defined by corporations releasing products and services without any thought given to consequences or even such piffling factors as ethics and morality.  SpaceX, an Elon Musk company, pushed 100s of satellites into the sky [causing havoc for earthbound astronomers](https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/spacex-starlink-problem-astronomy/). The company has plans for a total of 2700 low-earth orbit satellites which is slightly more than 50% of the existing number of objects in low-earth orbit.

[ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) joined other machine learning tools released this year and while the current version of the tool generates very authentic looking text it has a habit of just making up references when needed. At the moment its main threat is to replace the poor SOBs that have to write content for SEO marketing websites but it is quite easy to see the problems inherent in it.

What are more problematic tools are machine-learning art tools, like [Midjourney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney), that take text prompts and create impressive looking artwork from them. They can also help you create [fake photos of people in their office with naked women](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/thanks-to-ai-its-probably-time-to-take-your-photos-off-the-internet/) or take your art style and create a rendering 'plugin' that duplicates the course features of the style. These machine learning systems were 'trained' using art that was scraped off the internet with no permission and is being used to [create work based on those images with no permission](https://universeodon.com/@JudyHelfrich/109496160489322889). 

And this is moving faster than I think anyone could have predicted. Just recently author John Scalzi had to contact his publisher because they were [using a piece of generated artwork on a cover of his upcoming book](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2022/12/10/an-update-on-my-thoughts-on-ai-generated-art/). The particularly wonderful thing in this is that the publisher was unaware of this because they had purchased a piece of stock art for the cover and were not aware that it was artificially generated.  Stock art publishers are already generating 1000s of pieces of art and [putting them up for sale](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/adobe-stock-begins-selling-ai-generated-artwork/). 

## Free for all

The common thread linking SpaceX and the various machine learning tools attempting to replace human creativity (aside from Elon Musk) is that they are all underscored by a contemptuous view of other people and their rights. While there is legislation in many countries that would stop SpaceX offering Starlink services in their territory there is nothing that stops a company from launching 1000s of satellites into the sky to build that service. Part of the issue might be that when laws such as the [Outer Space Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Space_Treaty) were written that no-one could conceive of a corporate entity that would have the resources of a nation-state and be able to do this.  And I suspect that at no point did anyone think that a CEO would take that step into cartoonish supervillany and vandalise the night sky. 

The case of the various machine learning tools foisted upon us is even more interesting. Laws have been slow to keep pace with corporations but they are at an effective stasis when compared with the speed at which operations like OpenAI can operate. Before anyone can ask if it is legal to sample the collected artworks of the entire internet for a machine learning system aimed at replacing artists, OpenAI had already done it. And they can't really say that they didn't think there might be any illegality involved because they made sure to distance themselves by having a third-party do the downloading for "academic purposes". Its rather like the Artful Dodger trying to avoid a prison sentence by claiming that his pack or ragamuffin thieves were all independent contractors. 

## Horse 1 - Barn Door 0

Most of these endeavours seem to be predicated on two concepts. They will be done the most egregious theft or defilement of the environment before anyone can do anything about it and that this will lead to acceptance. There are probably various MBA and corporate phrases to describe it but really it is just businesses being assholes as fast as they can and hoping that they don't piss off people enough that they start gathering torches and pitchforks. 

Or calling their local politicians. 

This is probably a succinct way to describe modern capitalism in general but most companies don't really have the resources, or the sheer hubris, to try to replace human creativity with machine learning black boxes. Well maybe Nestlé but that is probably just a affirmational goal for them that they have posted in their boardroom.

And in a nutshell, it appears that the goal of OpenAI and other similar companies is to create technology that they can use to either replace writers and artists or drive them from the market with so much content that they can't compete on price. Or at any metric. It's as if some AI wonk saw the Fivver website and said decided to drive it out of business. "Hold my beer" indeed.

## I didn't order that

When I think about these various new machine learning tools I ask myself what societal problem are they solving. Or, more specifically, who wanted this? Is it good that there will be more people online via Starlink? Yes, but why do we need to permanently scar the night sky to do it. Is it fun to send ridiculous prompts to a web site and get paintings and photographs back? No doubt but why do we need to put artists and writers out of work? 

There are pressing needs that we as a planetary society want solved and none of them involve artificially creating images of us as Marvel characters to use as social media avatars or having chat bots write the final chapter of our Masters thesis for us. That is what we get though, unasked for or not, because some venture capitalists decided that they needed more money to feather their nests with.

Some people are of the opinion that we can't put the 'genie back in the bottle' but I think that is simply defeatist talk. Maybe we can't. Maybe we are stuck with these tools but that doesn't mean that we can't at least try to shut them down. If you are as disturbed about these technologies as I am I urge you to write to your national politicians and tell them that these tools need to be outlawed. Entirely. These serve no necessary purpose and they pose immense threats to society. They need to be put down and the first step is writing politicians to demand that they do something while we still have the time. 

And while you are writing, ask politicians why this system is allowed to occur in the first place. Why do we let companies like Meta, Google, OpenAI, SpaceX and others "move fast and break things" when the 'things' in question are the livelihoods of people and the stability of our society.
