Several changes afoot today.

## Fosstodon

I found out the other day that the fellow who is running [home.social](https://home.social/) was going to be shutting it down. I imagine that his workload went from hobby-level to dev-op nightmare fairly quickly. I looked around for a new home but decided that since a vast majority of the people I was following on Mastodon were on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/) that I would move there. Saves the commute time for the bits that make up each post.

Moving was fairly easy but I would recommend that, if you are going to change instances, that you export your following, mute and block lists as those are the items that are slow to migrate. 

So I have [a new home](https://fosstodon.org/@lolbat). Hopefully I can stay there for a bit of time. 

## The blog

A new Mastodon URL meant a change to my Hugo config.toml file. And will I was there I added Codeberg as a social media option. It was a quick change to make and the only issue was creating an inverted colour version of the Codeberg .svg file so that it would look okay on the black background.  It is/was a fairly minor change but the one nice thing was that I actually knew how to get it done without having to search for a solution. Hugo is a nice system but it can be a bit arcane at times. It was nice to fix something without a web search. 

## The browser

I got, another, invite to Arc and decided to give it a try after [an effusive post](https://tidbits.com/2023/05/01/arc-will-change-the-way-you-work-on-the-web/) by Adam Engst. Adam is a fellow who doesn't gush often [^1] so when he does I tend to take notice. You really do owe it to yourself to read the post even if you have no interest in Arc. It is a very good look at how to document the workflow of a complex application. 

I am giving Arc a test run and in order to try to understand what it is and how it works I am going to a) use it as the developers have imagined and b) use it in a way that isn't how I usually use a browser. 

Arc has an unusual UI. There is a single HTML display area and that stays the same no matter which Space you are in. If you "open" a tab it actually populates in the Spaces area to the left of the HTML display. I quite this. The tab is opened for later reading but it doesn't intrude on what you are doing at the moment. 

Currently I have three Spaces - Browsing, Project and Mail. One space is for random browsing, a second is for the doc pages for Textual and the final one is a dramatic change for me in that I am using the Gmail and Proton Mail web clients. I had, for a brief time, the Fosstodon.org web page opened but the Mona app does such a good job of letting you browse through and read Mastodon that I quickly pulled it. 

## Me

I have been in an odd mental space for the last week or so. And not my normal "I have work to do - Look a new dev tool!" ADHD state of mind that makes it so much fun to be with me [^2]. I have been particularly scatter-brained and prone to follow a trail of web pages like a beagle at a rabbit farm. 

I decided yesterday that I just don't care anymore. I don't have any real obligations other than to my family at the moment and I am just not going to get too anxious about the fact that I have "fallen behind" on a coding project that I am just doing for fun. 

I realise that I am in a privileged position. Not everyone can do this. Yet I still carry around this random stress about not accomplishing tasks that I have set myself. I am going to try to not do this anymore. I am going to just try to work on things until they stop being fun and then put them aside until I gain interest in them again. 

And that is just going to have to be okay.
