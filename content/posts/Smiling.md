There is an article making the rounds online, [AI and the American Smile](https://medium.com/@socialcreature/ai-and-the-american-smile-76d23a0fbfaf), that is a very interesting look at the social construction of the meaning of a smile. I found it rather interesting especially since my facial expressions have been a constant source of problems for me.

Doing a search for [autism facial expressions](https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=autism%20facial%20expressions) leads to a wealth of articles and papers discussing the problems that people with spectrum disorders have in reading facial expressions and having their own moods misrepresented. Throughout my life I have been seen as constantly angry or inappropriately unconcerned. I think that "angry" is just my normal face and when I look "unconcerned" it is me trying to show interest.

I have had to have a few discussions with one of the twins about how she presents to the world and how to gauge people. She is currently in the process of being diagnosed [^1] and has a lot of difficulty figuring people's emotional state. She also has my problem of having 'resting serial killer face'.

Part of the advice I try to give her is to try to project her positive emotions by over-emphasising them when she smiles. She worries that this will make her look like an idiot and this is a fear that I have always shared. That making the effort to seem as happy as I feel or as welcoming as I want people to feel will make me look like an idiot. 

My lifetime has been chronicled with picture after picture of me looking uninterested or annoyed. They are all, with a few exceptions, pictures where I have been trying to smile. I am also usually squinting as many of the photos were taken outside and the sun is always too bright for me. The happiest photo I recall seeing of me was when I was quite young and at my grandparents farm. I am wearing a battered old cowboy hat and digging in the dirt. I am unaware of the camera and smiling quite madly.
