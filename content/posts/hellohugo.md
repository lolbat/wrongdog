If you are here reading this post then you have found my blog in its new home. I was, until yesterday, using Wordpress as a hosting service but have moved all of my recent writing to this new location. There are two primary reasons for this. 

I might still be using Wordpress if I hadn’t made the mistake of viewing the site without my ad blocker and saw these:

![What compelling ads](/images/ads.jpeg)

At the bottom of every blog post were a series of ads from companies such as Outbrain. These ads are typically scams or the worst sort of clickbait. I understand that Automattic needs to bring in revenue to pay for the server that I was using but these ads are the bottom of the barrel.

Automattic likes to brag that they serve 43% of the web’s pages and you would think, if that is true, that they could find better ads to serve. Surely companies would want to be able to put their message onto pages that people obligingly tag to make it easier to target ads? And target 43% of the internet from one company? That may be possible but it seems that no-one at Automattic is doing it. Or perhaps no-one cares.

Instead my blog gets defaced with crap from Outbrain. No thanks.

I also want more control over the way the articles look as well as how much is being loaded when people view the pages. I am writing 1000-1600 word articles and I don't want, nor need, anything fancy for my site. Some navigation, the ability to tag articles and that is about it.  Even a "minimal" Wordpress theme comes with MBs of JavaScript and CSS that are really unnecessary. And Wordpress itself loads even more JS and CSS to create huge pages. It is a waste.

When you put material online that you have created I think it is necessary for you not only to control what you say but also how it is being presented and what accompanies it. All of these things determine how your work is viewed by other people. I just want folks to come here, read what I have written and thengo on with the rest of their day. 

With this new site I have stripped the HTML, CSS and JS down considerably and built a theme (reworked an existing theme to be accurate) that just shows an article with as little extraneous frippery as possible. I like it and I hope that you do as well.
