Over the last week I took some time and read through [Going Infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_Infinite) by [Michael Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lewis). There has been a lot of criticism about the book. So, so many.

The issues that people have with the book can be summed up with a quote from Molly White's review [^1].

> A writer of Lewis’s caliber presumably also knows of many parables about people who get too close to a subject to be able to view it objectively, too, but those don’t earn a place in the book.

Molly White - [Review: Michael Lewis's Going Infinite](https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/review-michael-lewiss-going-infinite) 

I think that this is a) directly to the point and b) ignores Michael Lewis' previous work. Lewis is not a journalist. Even Moneyball, probably his most famous title, had [its share of controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball#Reception) touching on some of the same issues. Michael Lewis appears to have two modes. There is the writer who goes and hangs out with people to find an interesting story to write (Moneyball, Going Infinite) and the Lewis who writes about economic issues without a central subject ([Boomerang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang:_Travels_in_the_New_Third_World)). I suspect that a lot of people who had read Boomerang were hoping that Lewis would apply that same level of analysis. I also suspect that it wasn't ever going to be possible because Lewis appears to "hang out" with his subjects and gets quite friendly with them. 

Molly white writes:
> The time Lewis spent observing Bankman-Fried in the company’s ritzy Bahamian offices, joining him on travels abroad, and even accompanying him to parties where they brushed elbows with the likes of Hillary Clinton and Leonardo DiCaprio certainly seems to have endeared the fallen billionaire and now accused fraudster to Lewis, who throughout the book continuously overlooks red flags and omits context that would paint a very different picture.

Lewis commiserates with SBF because he has become chummy with him. John Ray, the disaster specialist CEO who comes into try to save the company after it is put into bankruptcy protection doesn't get the benefit of Lewis' doubt. Neither do the lawyers from Sullivan & Cromwell who are the legal firm in charge of the bankruptcy proceedings. 

It is a jarring point in the book. A critical and mentally engaged Michael Lewis suddenly pops up from the pages and starts being accusatory and reading between the lines. Sometimes the lines appear to be ones that Lewis can see. This contrast between the easy-going Lewis who doesn't seem to spend much time doubting what he is told by SBF and the Lewis who is distrustful of John Ray and Sullivan & Cromwell illustrates the deficiencies in the book. 

Going Infinite is an interesting look at how FTX was created and the smooth and clear path that Sam Bankman-Fried had from university to FTX. It also provides a look into some areas of the crypto landscape that people might not have been familiar with. It is clearly not journalism though. Michael Lewis dropped into FTX and started to get comfortable with the staff and SBF and then the rug got pulled and suddenly he was in a crime drama. His old notes were no longer going to be up to the task of writing about what people were going to want to know [^2]. 

FTX went from a feel-good story about a weird kid who got shockingly rich to a forensic accounting drama about a weird kid who got really greedy. Going Infinite would have been a better book if Lewis has stopped as soon as the last FTX employees left the Bahamas. It wouldn't have answered any of the pressing questions people had about FTX but then it wasn't ever going to do that anyway. 


[^1]: It really is a good read.
[^2]: I can't comment on the defense of SBF that he has done in the last month or so as I haven't read or seen any of it.
