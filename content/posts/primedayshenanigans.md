I have [written previously](/posts/why-we-cant/) about how arbitrage has been affecting the type and quality of stories that you find online. It is, depending on the site and the current data, a bit of a shitshow with tech and news sites posting content that is there only to drive readers to [sign up for Netflix](https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/2023/7/8/23780340/best-thriller-movies-netflix-watch-july-2023) or [buy some video games](https://www.engadget.com/best-relaxing-video-games-140048572.html). Mashable, as well as other sites, has an entire category of [these types of articles](https://mashable.com/roundups).

The chum filled kiddie pool for arbitrage, or affiliate, marketing writing is Amazon's Prime Day [^1]. Even websites that don't normally participate in this type of content creation find themselves unable, or more likely unwilling, to avoid writing the odd article with affiliate links to Amazon. My impression, when browsing this previous Prime Day, was that the articles about it were unusually prominent and that there were more of them than I was used to seeing. 

I don't have any historical data for this phenomena but I decided to do some amateur statistical analysis of a few sites and see what the results were. For this, I used the [The Brutalist Report](https://brutalist.report/) website to get 24 hours worth of links for a series of websites. I then revisited the Brutalist site this morning and got another 24 hours worth of links from the same sites. Most of these are not sites that I visit usually.

With that data in hand I counted the number of articles posted and then counted the number of posts that were affiliate marketing material. This is not a rigorous measure. I decided that an article was for arbitrage purposes if it was a link to Prime Days sales [^2], mentioned a price or price reduction in the title, was a listicle of products based around a theme or was information about shows coming or going from a streaming service. Some leeway was given for content that would be considered affiliate marketing elsewhere but was 'on topic' for the site in question [^3].

## The data

| Site          | Posts Prime | Affiliate Posts |   %   | Regular Posts | Affiliate Posts |   %   |
| :---          |    :---:    |   :---:   | :---: |  :---:  |   :---:   | :---: |
| Wired         |     28      |    23     | 82.1% |    9    |     0     | 0.0%  |
| The Verge     |     39      |    18     | 46.2% |   28    |     2     | 7.1%  |
| Engadget      |     49      |    35     | 71.4% |   18    |     0     | 0.0%  |
| Apple Insider |     28      |    12     | 42.9% |   17    |     3     | 17.6% |
| Polygon       |     38      |    28     | 73.7% |   13    |     5     | 38.5% |
| Kotaku        |     15      |     3     | 20.0% |   12    |     2     | 16.7% |
| Gamespot      |     49      |    34     | 69.4% |   22    |     4     | 18.2% |
| PC Gamer      |     27      |     5     | 18.5% |   25    |     0     | 0.0%  |
| The A.V. Club |     19      |     3     | 15.8% |   12    |     0     | 0.0%  |
| Mashable      |     49      |    31     | 63.3% |   32    |    15     | 46.9% |

There is a **lot** of affiliate marketing content posted on Prime Day. That seems much like saying that it is hot on a sunny day but I was rather taken aback by the numbers. Not only is it that some sites will be up to 80% arbitrage content on Prime Day but that some sites, such as Wired and Engadget, will produce so much of it when they normally don't do so. 

### Affiliate posts by day 
| Site          |  Prime Day | Regular Day |   %    |
| :---          |    :---:    |  :---:  | :---:  |
| Wired         |     23      |    0    |   ∞    |
| The Verge     |     18      |    2    | 900.0% |
| Engadget      |     35      |    0    |   ∞    |
| Apple Insider |     12      |    3    | 400.0% |
| Polygon       |     28      |    5    | 560.0% |
| Kotaku        |      3      |    2    | 150.0% |
| Gamespot      |     34      |    4    | 850.0% |
| PC Gamer      |      5      |    0    |   ∞    |
| The A.V. Club |      3      |    0    |   ∞    |
| Mashable      |     31      |   15    | 206.7% |

Every site sees a dramatic increase in the amount of affiliate content they post on Prime Day. Four of the sites have their increase listed as **∞** because they don't appear to post that type of content normally. Everyone wants to get in on the potential money available by links to Prime Day sales [^4].

### Posting increase

| Site          | Posts Prime | Regular |   %    |
| :---          |    :---:    |  :---:  | :---:  |
| Wired         |     28      |    9    | 311.1% |
| The Verge     |     39      |   28    | 139.3% |
| Engadget      |     49      |   18    | 272.2% |
| Apple Insider |     28      |   17    | 164.7% |
| Polygon       |     38      |   13    | 292.3% |
| Kotaku        |     15      |   12    | 125.0% |
| Gamespot      |     49      |   22    | 222.7% |
| PC Gamer      |     27      |   25    | 108.0% |
| The A.V. Club |     19      |   12    | 158.3% |
| Mashable      |     49      |   32    | 153.1% |

Most sites increase the number of articles they post. Interestingly the largest increases in post count are seen on sites that normally don't partake in affiliate marketing. Wired and Engadget see some of the biggest increases along with Polygon and Gamespot. 

The number of posts that any site makes on an average day will vary. As will the number of arbitrage articles they post so these percentages will subsequently vary depending on what day you check a site out as well as if there are any [seasonal opportunities](https://skimlinks.com/blog/3-content-ideas-for-fathers-day/) for producing quality content.

## Sweeping generalisations ahead

There must be a lot of money to be made linking to Amazon during Prime Day. According to Reuters Amazon made $12.7 billion US in sales over the two day event. The average order was  $54.05 US. It is difficult to find specific data on how much sites make through referral programs such as Amazon. The site will give a referrer [$3 US per person that signs up for Prime](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/topic/t77) [^5]. The site also offers [differing reward values](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/help/node/topic/GRXPHT8U84RAYDXZ) based on the type of product that is being linked to. Ever wonder why so many sites link to [Instant Pots](https://search.brave.com/search?q=prime%20days%20instant%20pot) when they have nothing to do with cookware? It is because the Instant Pot is one of the highest paying items on Amazon. 

The money has to be of enough value, and easily gained, that sites like Wired are willing to post articles linking to Prime Day deals. Even when this isn't a revenue stream that they normally pursue. This speaks to the corrupting influence of these types of programs. If sites like Mashable and Polygon will use 20-40% of their article space on a regular basis to promote other affiliate programs it makes you wonder just how much Wired or PC Gamer will make over the course of Prime Days. 

### The inevitable "AI" angle

There is a lot of concern, rightly, being raised about the potential impact of LLM systems like ChatGPT and how they can be used to generate volumes of bullshit. Filling Google and Bing's search results with even more garbage than is already there. We are already seeing web sites, typically run by hedge funds, using LLM content generation systems to create content. None of it is very good or even accurate. How accurate or even well-written does a piece of content need to be to link to Amazon Instant Pot pages? 

One has to assume that the limiting factor for Wired and others is that they don't want to pay writers, on a yearly basis, to create lists of movies leaving Netflix or video games that have a summer vibe? What happens to their business model if the cost to create that content is effectively only reputational? Does [Red Ventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Ventures) go on a buying spree and pick up more sites to help expand the model they are using at C|Net?

## Which internet apocalypse do you subscribe to?

People worry about search engines being flooded with even more ad-bait content farms and disinformation. This is a concern but what frightens me is the dilution of traditional publishing to the point where even the previously legitimate content online is just sales fodder for Amazon, Walmart or some other giant online retailer. Magazines and newspapers are close to their last breath. Google and Facebook stole all of their advertising revenue and Craigslist took all of their classified ads. Some media made a moderately successful move online but did so at the price of selling page space to material that, in past years, would have been marked as an advertorial. 

My worry is that at some point in the future the combination of LLM systems and MBAs with no social conscience will lead to an internet that is divided between sites that are nothing more than wordy catalogue entries for online retailers and small blogs, like this one, that no-one can find. 

_If you are interested I [posted a zip](/affiliate.zip) file with the article titles and spreadsheets I used to create the data in this post._ 

[^1]: Or at least in the US. I don't think that as many people in Canada use Prime. I have no clue how popular it is in Europe or the UK. 

[^2]: Obviously one would think. 

[^3]: This came up a lot less than I thought it would. 

[^4]: Not all sales [are actually sale prices](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/11/1186819298/amazon-prime-day-deals-bargains-sales) as people have learnt in the past. The problem is significant enough that even Mashable tries to [warn their readers](https://mashable.com/article/how-to-spot-bad-deals-amazon-prime-day). Whether you will see an article like that in the flood of Prime Day discount links is another thing.  

[^5]: Which is why you see site's urging you to sign up for Prime or reminding you that you need to be a Prime member to participate in the offers they are posting.
