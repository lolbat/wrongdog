description: If Exile in Guyville was supposedly inspired by the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St. It is difficult to see how this is the case given how bad Exile on Main St. actually is.

One of my favourite songs is _Divorce Song_ from Liz Phair's debut album _[Exile in Guyville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_in_Guyville)_. My partner thinks that it is a sad song but, perhaps based on my own relationship history, I find it a bittersweet song. It seems to be about having to work through the end of a relationship knowing that it is over but still having to maintain your composure while you untangle yourself from the connections you have built. 

I am not sure how it happened but it took me quite some time to learn that the songs in Guyville were written as a response to the tracks in the Rolling Stones' _Exile on Main St._ [^1]. Perhaps this is because I really don't listen to the Stones much. Even the best Stones' songs tend to be a good guitar riff and a popping intro followed by variations of the same for three minutes. That said, I do think that _Tumbling Dice_ is a pretty good song but 1 for 18 is not a winning percentage. 

I also tend to be a firm believer in [George Carlin's adage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dcr8dm9Prkk) that "white people don't sing the blues, they give you the blues". I can't help but think that any group of pasty, thin white men trying to follow in their footsteps now would be laughed off the stage. Or one would hope that they would be. Jagger went to the [London School of Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jagger#Early_life_and_education) FFS. Not much in that life to use to fuel your blues. Although there are [worse examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbOg5XX9Ud0&pp=ygUZbXVkZHkgd2F0ZXJzIGJsdWVzIHNvIGJhZA%3D%3D) of this. 

Whatever the reason for my ignorance, I decided to make a playlist that had each song from _Exile on Main St._ followed by the reply from _Exile in Guyville_. The idea was to listen through the playlist to see if I could determine where and how the origin was evident. Sadly that didn't work for me. The main problem is that the playlist doesn't make for good listening. As I mentioned, I really don't care for the Stones. They always strike me as the origin of the typical "rock guys". How far distant are the Stones from The Libertines? 

The other issue is that it is difficult to see the connections between the songs. There appears to be no call and response between Jagger and Phair. This isn't helped by the lack of emotional content in most of the songs on _Exile on Main St._ Liz Phair clearly feels her songs. I don't think that the Stones do. 

Take this example from _Ventilator_:

> _When you're trapped and circled with no second chances_
> _Your code of living is your gun in hand_
> _We can't be browed by beating, we can't be cowed by words_
> _Messed by cheating, ain't gonna ever learn_

It is trying to engender the energy of the downtrodden and mistreated without any connection to any of those states. It is performative suffering. Music written by and listened by people who keep forgetting that they are "the man" and not the disaffected generation they think they are. Even the attempts at wordplay aren't really all that clever. It is all surface and flex without any emotion.

Compare that example to _Divorce Song_:

> _And it's true that I stole your lighter_
> _And it's also true that I lost the map_
> _But when you said that I wasn't worth talking to_
> _I had to take your word on that_

Or this from _Stratford on Guy_:

> _The stewardess came back and checked on my drink_
> _In the last strings of sunlight, a Brigitte Bardot_
> _'Cause I had on my headphones along with those eyes_
> _That you get when your circumstance is movie-sized_

I think that the core concept of _Exile on Guyville_ is revealed in this [Rolling Stone article](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/he-said-she-said-how-liz-phair-took-the-rolling-stones-to-guyville-73618/) from 2010.

>  “I remember telling my boyfriend I wanted to write a record but I didn’t know how,” she says. “I was a visual arts major and I concocted the idea that I needed a template — learn from the greats.” She started asking questions: Was it an important album? Did it sell a lot of copies? “He was like, yeah, it was a huge record for them, but it’s a double record, Liz.” Then he hit a nerve. “I can remember him sort of joking, ‘You should totally do that,’ but being sarcastic, as if I couldn’t possibly,”

Songs like _Strange Loop_, _Fuck and Run_ and _Help me Mary_ are about having to navigate around impositions that men place on her everywhere. The indie scene, her lovers and even just men taking up space and creating a mess in her house. Having her, at the time, boyfriend be dismissive of her ability to create an 18 track album is just the first thread in this series of incidents [^2]. 

_Exile on Main Street._ seems to be a handy scaffold to use to create the project and give it structure. The impetus for the songs on _Exile in Guyville_ may have come from the Stones but there is more in her responses to them than the content of the Stones' songs can provide. In the article I linked to Liz Phair mentions Urge Overkill more than the Stones. _Rip this Joint_ may have helped provide the theme for _Help me Mary_ but she talks about a more personal impact.

> “Rip This Joint” is totally about their lifestyle and I’m like, sitting in the apartment when these rock stars come in being like, and look at the mess you make, I feel extremely uncomfortable with you here. It was Nash [Kato] and Blackie [Onassis] and all those guys from Urge Overkill and Material Issue and stuff. I’m like, did you guys not realize how you impact me?

Jagger and Co. are just more popular versions of the dickheads she has had to deal with. It is easier to promote an album and talk about the effect a Stones single had than it is to talk about members of indie bands that trashed her living room. I think that the discussion of how her music relates to the Stones is a gloss over the story of how she has had to navigate men through her life. And really how this happens to every woman.

I think that the story of the two albums is more complex than we get to see in short reviews and videos. I would be curious to learn just how much of this story gets pulled out in the editorial process or just how much Liz Phair doesn't want to just say "this is an album about men being shitheads and the Rolling Stones are the best example of that". She has had to deal with a lot of shit and abuse in her career and I wouldn't blame her for wanting to avoid getting even more from music critics who tend to idolise acts like The Rolling Stones. Or The Libertines. 

[^1]: I don't think that the relationship is as direct as many people may say.
[^2]: The fact that Mick Jagger was a dick to her when she met him is just icing on that particular brand of shitty cake.
