I recently listened to an episode of the Search Engine podcast titled "[Is there a sane way to use the Internet?](https://pjvogt.substack.com/p/how-do-i-use-the-internet-now)". The host, PJ Voyt, was talking with [Ezra Klein](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/id1548604447) about how to detoxify your brain and life from the mess that Twitter and Facebook make of it. It is a very interesting show and I recommend that you listen to it. 

One aspect of the interview that I found particularly relevant to my own interests was when Ezra veered into a discussion of the problem that web-based media outlets face and how Vice and others suffered from their association with Facebook. Facebook sent sites enormous amounts of traffic and many [^1] pivoted to try to take advantage of that audience to try to generate business and money.

That advertising money never showed up because, as Ezra Klein explains, Facebook took it all [^2]. These sites took VC investment in anticipation of that windfall arriving and when it didn't happen the suits took over. According to Klein, Vice makes a substantial profit but [went bankrupt](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkap5v/vice-media-llc-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy) because of the interest on the loans it had to take to pay off VC funds that were withdrawing their funding. 

Some time ago I was having a discussion on a forum about the efficacy of the [POSSE publishing model](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) and just how useful Facebook really was. One of the forum moderators replied:

> So: 100% of the <forum name snipped> audience sees my post, and it gets 20 reactions.
>
> 10% of the Facebook audience sees my post, and it gets 200 reactions.
>
> What should I conclude from that?

Now this is a good question and to answer it I need to refer to the podcast I mentioned earlier. Klein talks about this very aspect. That it was easy to click a Like button or even open a link for a quick read of an article [^3]. What wasn't happening was that they weren't growing an audience of people that were genuinely interested in their reporting. My suspicion is that small organizations using Facebook as a way to market to "their audience" will suffer the same problem. 

Facebook does a significant amount of work to try to increase the amount of time that you stay on their site. They have predictive routines that they use to [rank all of the possible content](https://transparency.fb.com/features/ranking-and-content/) that you can see. The primary heuristic used to determine if you see something is how you will engage with the content. Not that you follow a page or that you have liked the content. Additionally, content is graded based on how other people interacted with it. If more people Liked a post or interacted with it in a way that Facebook deemed to be positive then it got a better grade and was more likely to appear on a feed. 

I [commented about this](https://zacgaming.wordpress.com/2015/01/24/facebook-organic-reach-is-bs/) on another blog back in 2015 (there is a dead link from a transfer from an even older blog).  

To reference the response above, the critical issue is that the post was only seen by 10% of "their audience". And to me that means that if I can't access 100% of the people who want to hear from me then that audience isn't mine. It is an audience created, maintained and controlled by Facebook. 

In response to their reply I asked:

> Well what is a "reaction" and what does that mean? What value does it supply? Does it actually have any value at all?

Ezra Klein would say that the reaction has no value. I would also point out that there are, AFAICT, no tools that will let you link audience reaction on Facebook to some meaningful value. Facebook will give you many tools to help determine the efficacy of your ads but then you have to purchase ads to get access to them. Facebook does provide tools for people that maintain Pages but in my experience all those do is measure audience participation on Facebook. They don't help you do anything other than make your posts more likely to succeed on Facebook. 

This lack of accountability (and accounting in general) is what makes Facebook difficult for small publishers to leave. They get a lot of reaction from their posts on Facebook but there isn't any way to prove that this has any value. Which also means that it is difficult to definitively show that they don't. Game, set and match to Facebook. 

It takes a brave business owner or manager to take a leap and to stop maintaining their primary marketing presence via Facebook. Much like the recent revelations of the lack of impact on [NPR leaving Twitter](https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/14/freedom-of-reach/) I suspect that the actual impact of Facebook on a companies ability to promote and market products is negligible if they move to using a [POSSE model](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). It just takes some strength to try.
