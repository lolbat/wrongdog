For the last year or so I have been working on a MacBook Air. This was fine when all I was doing was writing but as I am doing coding I was finding the small screen size to be limiting. So yesterday I went our and bought a 24" monitor, a stand for the MacBook and an Anker USB C port to allow the MacBook to drive the monitor. 

My partner has an LG monitor that is larger and also has a USB C port that lets you connect your Mac directly to the monitor for video output as well as powering it. Sadly that port costs you about $100 regardless of the manufacturer of the monitor. Since I needed a USB hub to attach my old keyboard to the laptop it seemed a bit extravagant. 

Moving the PyCharm window from my laptop to the new monitor required me to lower the font size I was using for my code windows. I am not sure why this is the case but not only is the window larger but I can see more code in them with the reduced type size.

My keyboard is probably more than ten years old but it still works quite well. The keys are oddly smaller than the keys on my MacBook and so I am having a bit of trouble getting used to typing on it. I will have more typos to correct in the next week I am sure. An added bonus is that the keyboard has a numeric keypad and a set of home/end/page up/page down keys so I can actually use those functions. You would be surprised at the number of games that use those keys.

One unexpected impact of this new setup is that I have decided to make the laptop a permanent resident of my "office" in the basement. The majority of what I do doesn't really require a laptop and I will be fine using my iPad for most of the other things I do during the day. 

I already miss the trackpad on the MacBook. I have a Logitech M705 optical mouse that I bought to play Warhammer II on my laptop and it is a nice piece of tech but it isn't really the same as a trackpad. I will be saving up and getting one of the new Apple trackpads in the next month or so. Hopefully the mouse doesn't kill my wrist before then.
