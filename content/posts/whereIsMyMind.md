I drink quite a bit of strong tea. I don't really like strong tea but I tend to forget that I have it steeping. Invariably I will think "didn't I make a cup of tea" and then realise that I have left it steeping for twenty minutes. At least it is cool enough to drink by then. I normally have a timer set on my phone or computer but more times than not I either forget to set it or it goes off and I am too submerged in what I am doing to remember to go get my cup of tea. As of late I have been drinking more than normal.

My mind has been particularly fuzzy as of late. From July to mid-September I was quite depressed. I didn't really manage to do much other than play a lot of Monster Train. I have [written before](/posts/breaking-languidly/) about what it means for my mental health when I start to play repetitive tower defence or deck building game. At some point I had unlocked all of the content in the game and was working at defeating level 20 of the 25 additional difficulty levels when I thought that perhaps I might want to go see my doctor. 

He helpfully suggested that I might want to try changing my ADHD medication and after a week or so I started to write a few blog posts and stopped playing Monster Train [^1]. That burst of activity lasted for a month and then I stopped being motivated to do much else other than read. I have read quite a few books but haven't really done a lot more other than that. 

## Do I really need to do anything?

This lack of "meaningful" activity has been bothering me for a while but last week I started to question whether I really, at my age, needed to accomplish anything other than keep the family fed and the house clean [^2]. What is this mania I have for accomplishing things and does it really need to be fed?

This would be a different matter if I wasn't at the point in my life that I am. I don't _need_ to work thanks to my partner and her job. I keep her fuelled with coffee and feed the family. I keep the house clean. And aside from that there really isn't any need for me to do anything else. And yet I am plagued by this incessant urge to "accomplish" something.

I missed quite a few opportunities to have worked on interesting projects and with interesting people when I was younger due to my inability to see a project through to the end. Once a project had passed the initial 90% completion mark I was usually gone. The final 10% of most projects is a chore. It is slogging through corrections, fixing bugs and being bored as hell. My favourite job of my entire working life was at DNA Multimedia where I was an R&D coder. People would see interesting effects in other products and ask me how to do them. So I would sit down, check out the effect and then work on coding it. Once I was done I would pass along the code and go on to the next project. 

Jobs like that are rare. More legend than paycheque. 

Despite my years I still look for that problem to solve. There aren't any though and so I tend to look for them. I think of projects to do, games to build, code to write. And because all of these are usually much bigger than my attention span I do a small part of it and then move on to something else once that 90% mark comes in view. 

I don't need to be continuing to this to myself. There isn't any need and there isn't any profit for myself. Not financial for certain but also no emotional gain. It is all peril and no glory. So I have been trying to say no to myself. To just approach the day as an opportunity to read, listen to some music and maybe play a game of [Field of Glory 2: Medieval](https://www.gog.com/en/game/field_of_glory_ii_medieval).  Once I have stopped my brain for clambering for new tasks I will look into finding a project to work on but, like a dog who doesn't get the treat while it whines for it, my brain has to learn to relax and find a different way to get the stimulation and dopamine it desires. 



[^1]: I did manage to complete all 25 difficulty levels first.
[^2]:  The dog also needs too be fed and walked but after ten minutes of his baleful glaring at me I tend to remember to do whetever it is he needs at the time.
