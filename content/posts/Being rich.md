Being rich isn't a job. Its not as if members of the 1% come home after a long day of being a billionaire and flop into a well-worn La-Z-Boy, pop open a can of a local discount lager and fall asleep watching the evening news. Being rich is a skill though and I think that Elon Musk is at the pinnacle of the craft of being rich. 

Now it isn't difficult to be rich. Almost anyone can do it and heaven pity the poor person, Eric Trump perhaps, who can't advance themselves even with all the benefits that come with a silver spoon in an orifice. Elon Musk though has done quite a lot with quite a lot and is still, even with all of his problems with Twitter and Tesla, the world's richest person. He has reached such a pinnacle that concerns about his personal politics are a relevant subject for public discourse. 

I think it is important to look at the status of being rich as a skill because I think it is important to remember this when we look at the public comments that Musk has ben making since his takeover of Twitter. Including some [interesting comments about pronouns](https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/diversity-inclusion/530666-elon-musk-sparks-controversy-about-pronouns-on/). If this was an older relative on Facebook making these comments or something that you overheard in a grocery lineup you would be in safe territory to immediately dismiss the source of the statement as a nutjob. Or perhaps someone who professionally repeats quips they heard on Fox News. 

It is dangerous though to read something as asinine as Musk's recent pronoun comment and dismiss it as the rambling of an idiot who has been reading too many of the replies in Andy Ngo's twitter feed.  If Musk really was as stupid as people are trying to portray him I don't think that he would be in the position that he is. I am certainly not any fan of Elon Musk. I think he is a certifiable cretin and the world would be a happier place without him or his ilk. What I do think is that it is an error to dismiss him no matter how ridiculous his comments are. He runs Tesla, Space-X, Twitter, Neuralink and SolarCity, founded Open AI and was involved, in some fashion, in the development of PayPal. I think he may have been the barber there. I'm not sure.

So you can either laugh at Musk and comment about how Twitter will soon only be the domain of white-power enthusiasts or you can wonder why the man who owns Tesla, Space-X and Neuralink is acting the way he is and what he thinks his end-game might be.

It is up to you
