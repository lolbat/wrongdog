There has been a lot of discussion and heat generated online about the increased popularity of subscriptions in Mac and iOS apps. As this is the internet it can be a bit toxic at times but I think that the discussion of subscriptions for software often blames developers when it should really be pointing the blame where it belongs - at Apple.

## Caveats

I am not a developer and I do not have a lot of experience with the App Store as a developer. I am not a fan of the model but I have subscribed to a few apps over the last few years. I am approaching this topic as a user of software and a fan of indie developers.

I am not going to be addressing the use of subscriptions by companies like Adobe and Apple. Any multi-billion or trillion dollar company that uses subscriptions does so because its executives are twats and they want to bleed their customers.

This will be about the issues surrounding indie app developers and subscriptions.

## The problem

The model for delivery and payment of software has changed dramatically in the past ten years [^1]. It used to be that you would purchase software from the developer's website (or more likely from their "store" on a site like Kagi) and then get a download link. When a new major version of the app came out you could upgrade for a reduced price and you went through the same process. Kagi could even provide serial keys to users.

The model was good enough to help build companies such as [Barebones](https://www.barebones.com/), [Panic](https://panic.com/) and [The Omni Group](https://www.omnigroup.com/).

Kagi [shut down operations](https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/01/kagi-shuts-down/) in 2016 in part due to the increased ease with which developers could process their own payments using PayPal and Stripe. In addition to payment processing, it became easier for developers to spin up servers to provide serial keys and other services.

In addition, the Mac App Store [opened in 2011](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/06/mac-app-store-turns-10/) and has slowly been eating the market for buying and discovering Mac applications since then.

Since 2016, the ability for developers to create a sustainable income stream has become more difficult and many have moved to a monthly or yearly subscription model in order to keep the lights on and keep people employed. This is a problem but not for any reasons that relate directly to developers. I think that most people agree that developers should be paid and be able to put a roof over their heads.

## The Apple Tax

If you see a subscription price for a Mac or iOS app and think it is too high then ask yourself if a 30% discount would seem more reasonable? Apple did announce [a reduced 15% rate](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/03/enrollment-for-reduced-15-apple-app-store-commission-begins) for smaller developers but I am not sure how many developers are being given that reduced rate. In addition, Apple [sets price tiers](https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-beginners-guide-to-app-store-pricing-tiers/) and the exchange rates for applications. This makes it easier for developers to sell their software in the 1[55 different countries](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/reference/app-store-pricing-and-availability-start-times-by-region) that Apple serves but it also restricts developers.

One could argue that the price that Apple takes is worth the services they provide to developers. Perhaps. But what if a dev isn't interested in selling their app to people in Grenada or Kazakhstan? Or what if they don't want the analytics Apple provides?

It is difficult to answer those questions because there is no competition. Apple has a monopoly on all iOS app sales and a significant percentage of Mac app releases. So if developers want to  distribute to a smaller market or use a service with fewer features for a smaller cut of their sales they are SOL. They have to accept a 15-30% cut of their proceeds disappearing. Off the top. Before any bills are paid.

## Assholes

It is not news that the internet is filled with assholes [^2]. What has always surprised me is that companies like Apple seem to build systems that reward people being twats.

Not only has this person created a new account to post the same one-star review but Apple created, and continues to use, a review system that promotes this type of behaviour. Reviews online are typically a cesspit and filled with single star offerings from people who have their own agenda and want to get attention for their "hot take". I typically don't spend a lot of time looking at reviews on the App Store [^3] because for every review that I read that provided me with useful information there were 10 that were from trolls.

Sadly, since these reviews are public and have a direct impact on sales [^4] developers spend time responding to them. And responding to the same type of people on social media. And probably have their support email addresses flooded with crap from them as well.

The companies that control most of the traffic online have given their systems over to scammers, assholes and bots and don't seem to care. Part of the residual damage of this is that small developers spend far too much of their time and resources trying to deal with trolls who inform the debate around things like subscriptions despite being a fraction of the audience for an app.

## The App Store

The App Store is a mess. As a user it is an immense waste of time but developers are hampered by it as well. Apple still doesn't offer a simple way for developers to [provide paid upgrades](https://9to5mac.com/2022/03/17/mac-developers-complain-about-app-store-bundles-and-the-lack-of-paid-upgrades/). An issue that has been [plaguing developers since 2012](https://www.macstories.net/stories/why-upgrade-pricing-isnt-coming-to-the-app-store/). If a developer doesn't have an easy way to charge upgrade pricing for a major new version of an app then what option do they have left other than subscriptions?

And Apple, based on its price tiers, gets more money from consumers and developers with monthly subscriptions than they do with a single payment. A monthly subscription of $1.99 nets Apple $3.58 but a single payment of $19.99 only nets then $2.99 [^5]. Apple has no real incentive to build out a system that makes it easy for developers to charge for upgrades.

While it is old, [this Tidbits article](https://tidbits.com/2020/08/13/developers-v-apple-outlining-complaints-about-the-app-store/) has a very good summary of some of the issues that developers did, and still do, have to deal with when selling through the App Store. Of special note is this comment:

> Developers have been distributing software online for a long time, with rates much, much lower than 30%â€”more like 3% to 8%. And they still do!

### Using the App Store

The concept of [enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys) has gained quite a lot of traction lately but I don't think that Apple gets enough credit for pursuing this idea for as long as they have. The process of getting apps on the App Store is distressing and arbitrary and finding apps on the App Store is filled with scams, copycat apps and now ads.

Almost every new indie developed app I use now has been suggested to me via Mastodon or someone's blog. The App Store makes it easy for me to keep my apps up-to-date but I was able to do that before Apple opened the App Store. Discovery of new apps on the App Store is a joke and with the addition of ads, Apple has made this worse and not better.

## What to do?

Subscriptions are an unfortunate fact of life for the moment. Developers have bills to pay like the rest of us  and Apple doesn't seem interested in providing developers with more payment options. When possible I try to buy my software directly from the developer. Not every developer offers this and I suspect that there are many don't have the time or resources to do so.

When I find an app that I like I make sure to promote it with **direct** links to the developer's website and product page. I added [a Tools page](https://whatiswrongwithyourdog.netlify.app/tools/) to my blog specifically to point out all of the great indie apps that help me create the blog. You may not have a vast readership or number of followers but these independent references help people find good software.

If/when you have the opportunity make sure that Apple knows, and maybe even your elected national representatives, that the App Store is nothing but a monopoly that seeks to suck as much money from consumers and developers as possible. Apple likes to talk about how much money they send to developers each year but the real story is that anywhere from 7-22% of that was money that developers used to put in their pockets.

If Apple wants to pocket that cash then they need to produce a compelling app store for consumers and developers and not just skim the cream off the sales price of an app and then leave us all looking at ads while trying to find a working app amongst all of the scams and copycat apps.
