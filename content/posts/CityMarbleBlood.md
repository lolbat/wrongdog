[Howard Andrew Jones](http://www.howardandrewjones.com/journal) was not a writer I was familiar with. That is probably a result of my reading habits straying away from the Sword & Sorcery tales I read in my youth. I only recently starting reading some of the authors that had fascinated me when I was younger - Moorcock, Wagner, Leiber and others. While doing so I started to wonder what new books and stories had been written in the genre and after some looking around discovered _[Lord of a Shattered Land](https://www.baen.com/lord-of-a-shattered-land.html)_. I am not sure if I saw it mentioned on [Black Gate](http://www.blackgate.com) [^1] or by [Robin Marx](https://mastodon.social/@RobinMarx/) but I picked it up and gave it a read.

The book is a re-imaging of the history of Hannibal and Carthage set in a world with sorcerers and magical creatures.  The hero of the book, Hanuvar, is on a quest to try to rescue the survivors of the city-state of Volanus which has been sacked by the army of the Dervan empire. The book is a series of linked short stories that are interspersed with "historical" commentary from a relative of the author of the texts Antires Sosilos (the Elder). The commentary at the end of each story is a fascinating way to add more background to the world without having to unceremoniously jam it into the narrative. The notes often also provide some foreshadowing to the following story in a way that makes you feel as if you are reading a serial.

Jones get compared to writers such as R.E. Howard but to my mind he is a more careful writer and less prone to vivid prose. Hanuvar also doesn't seem to relish the violence that he becomes involved in and has a more human list of aggrieving injuries that puts him at odds with characters like Conan or Kane. Like R.E. Howard, Moorcock and Leiber, Howard Jones gives the reader short bites of adventure as Hanuvar encounters spirits, magical beasts or sorcerers and witchcraft. The encounters all seem less contrived than older sword & sorcery works [^2] and more a natural result of the character existing in a world that is filled with magic.  

I am currently reading book two in the series, _[The City of Marble and Blood](https://www.baen.com/the-city-of-marble-and-blood.html)_, which (so far) feels more narratively connected than _Lord of a Shattered Land_. The first book used the historical notes at the end of each story as a way to provide an over-arching structure. In _The City of Marble and Blood_ has each story set in what feels like a set of chapters and less like distinct stories. They are also more *human* than typical sword & sorcery writing. Hanuvar encounters a wide array of people who properly inhabit their world and give it breadth and complexity.

I don't enjoy as many of the old sword & sorcery titles that I used to read but I do quite like Jones' Hanuvar adventures so far. He provides the same sort of chills and drama but
