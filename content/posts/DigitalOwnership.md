I used to own many, many more books than I currently do. Even when, as a student and in my early post-academic life, I used to move more frequently they would all be put into boxes and hauled to my new living quarters. I am not sure when it happened but I decided that I was quite done with owning *things* and slowly started to divest myself of the physical copies of most of my books [^2]. The ones that remain in my bookshelf are ones that I have an emotional attachment to or simply can't be found electronically.

This was my status-quo for years. I bought electronic copies of books that I couldn't find in the library or purchased the occasional non-fiction work that I knew I would be referring to multiple times. I have also picked up titles such as [Gödel, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gödel,_Escher,_Bach) that I have reread multiple times. This has also lead me to question how I tended to have an irrational desire to keep things that I probably shouldn't have bought in the first place. 

I have done all of my ebook reading using various iOS devices [^1] primarily my iPad. I have been thinking of replacing my iPad with a dedicated e-reader for some time now. The primary reason is that, despite the improvements in the weight, an iPad is not a comfortable device to hold. The arthritis in my wrist has gotten to the point where, no matter the orientation, my wrist gets very sore after reading for any amount of time. The same holds true for my iPhone which is much larger and heavier than I really want but is still one of the smaller phones I could get [^3]. 

While planning this move to a new device I started to think about all of the books I owned that I didn't actually *own*. When possible I try to buy ebooks directly from publishers. This often means that I have a digital copy of the book that I then load into Books but there are some titles that I have purchased through the Apple Book Store that I have had to make a backup of. 

Recently, Martha Wells' excellent book [Witch King](https://www.tor.com/2023/05/31/book-review-witch-king-by-martha-wells/) was available electronically for a much reduced price. The Tor.com site has links to Amazon, Books and other online retailers but doesn't sell the title directly. Their owner, Macmillan Publishing, [does sell direct](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250826794/witchking) but I bought the book via Apple and then started thinking about what to do to ensure that I had a backup. 

It is odd to think that the digital marketplace has changed so much that I now worry about keeping a copy of an electronic product. While Apple has given no indication that it will treat electronic media the same way that [Amazon has in the past](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106989048) or [Discovery recently did](https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-pulls-discovery-videos-playstation-users-already-own-sparking-concern-over-our-digital-future) with Playstation owners I don't feel comfortable waiting for that shoe to drop. Many publishers now allow you to buy titles without DRM and without having to use Amazon or Apple as an intermediary. Given the history of how corporations have treated the idea of ownership in the past I feel it much safer to make sure that I always have access to the books I buy.
