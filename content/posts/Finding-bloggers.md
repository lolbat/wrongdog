One of the topics that is on people's minds as of late are the poor results one gets when using a search engine. I've [commented on it](/tags/search-engines/) myself a few times. This is a significant problem when you are looking for specific content but it can be a bigger problem if you are looking for blogs and websites from interesting human beings.

## Back in the old days

When people, like me, wax poetically about the delightful days [^1] before Alta Vista and Google they talk about the process of finding new sites to be an iterative process. You found a interesting site and that site invariably had a page, or sidebar, with links to other sites. As you drilled down through each site you built up your own list of links. Some of the first search engines actually just [indexed these link pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search) from other sites. 

What is often missing from these discussions (perhaps it is assumed) is that the sites were created by individuals. They were the precursors to blogs and were the work of individuals who were excited by the nascent internet and eager to explore it. It was chaotic and often poorly done but it was a uniquely human experience. 

## Human?

It didn't seem like an important point to make at the time [^2] but, in this age of algorithmic content pushed at you from social media or content silos like Medium, everything was particularly human. The sites that a person curated were specific to their tastes and interests. They posted content because they thought it was interesting and not to expand their reach or to build an audience of people looking for CICD automation tips. 

Today it seems as if, even if you can find relevant content online, that it has been [built for machines first](https://search.brave.com/search?q=shops%20writing%20content%20for%20search%20engines) and for people secondly. Writers, even those on Medium and other sites, need to fit their content into the parameters that search engines like Google have deemed to be "good".

## What is in this tea cup?

Previously [Mastodon](/posts/mastodon/) was providing me with links to new and interesting content. As much as I think that Mastodon is a better social media experience [^3] it is still social media. A Mastodon instance might allow you to see a different type of content than you would find on Reddit or Twitter but it still rewards and facilitates viral content. It might be content that is less mainstream but it is still viral and virality requires a particular type of content. 

In the last few weeks I have been taking quite a few inadvertent deep dives into concepts. I might only stay interested in one for an hour or two but one idea that I have been pursuing is the idea of discovery of independent web sites and blog. 

Not being on social media means that sometimes tempests will erupt and you tend not to see them. Case in point, the recent decision of Google to [change their "privacy" policy](https://gizmodo.com/google-says-itll-scrape-everything-you-post-online-for-1850601486) to "allow" them to scrape any content that they want and add it to the vast sluice of material that they feed to their AI monster. Other people have [written on this](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/07/07/the-next-big-theft/) and [made suggestions](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/07/11/pulling-my-site-from-google-over-ai-training/) on how to stop Google from devouring your content and barfing out some melange of it and other writing via Bard. How they think that this is legal confuses me. What ever happened to asking for [permission](https://adactio.com/journal/20315)?

While looking at those various posts that I came across some useful tools.

## IndieWeb and directories

While some people have been complaining about search results, others have been trying to fix the problem. Ideas like webrings, which died out many years ago, as well as curated directories have been making a comeback. I am going to link to another Tracy Durnell page since she has done an impressive job of assembling [a list of links](https://tracydurnell.com/2021/10/05/indieweb-discovery/) but there are also some good links curated by [size of cat](https://sizeof.cat/post/website-discovery/).

What these sites all have in common is that they are curated and moderated by real people. They are small and they are slow to update but a lack of scale in processing means that you get better results. Getting a site listed on some of these directories can take days. That is geological time compared to Google and Bing. 

If we have learned anything from the last decade of algorithms and content to scale [^4] it is that fast and large just tend to generate a huge pile of shit. Facebook, Twitter, Google and Bing all have thrown out the idea of curation and moderation in order to just be bigger than anyone else.  What is the benefit of being able to access millions of sites or millions of writers if 99% of them are shit, scammers, SEO bullshit or generated by LLM systems?

It is slower to find good sites using these types of directories but even when the content you find isn't a match for your particular tastes it is at least written by a real person. 

## Search options

And you can now find [a search engine](http://wiby.me) that is focused on bloggers and writers but it can also be used to [build and serve](http://wiby.me/about/guide.html) your own search engine. 

The site's [About page](http://wiby.me/about/) sums up everything that has been discussed

> In the early days of the web, pages were made primarily by hobbyists, academics, and computer savvy people about subjects they were personally interested in. Later on, the web became saturated with commercial pages that overcrowded everything else. All the personalized websites are hidden among a pile of commercial pages. Google isn't great at finding them, its focus is on finding answers to technical questions, and it works well; but finding things you didn't know you wanted to know, which was the real joy of web surfing, no longer happens.

Check it out. Who knows what you'll find. 


[^1]: Just how bad are Google and Bing that people are looking back fondly on the days before search engines? 

[^2]: What else would it be other than human? Some person had to manually build those pages. Even the HTML pages were artisanal. 

[^3]: For the moment.

[^4]: And really have we ever learned anything? George Santayana has probably the most quoted aphorism of all time and also the least understood. Or perhaps the least acted upon.
