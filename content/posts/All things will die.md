The Guardian posted an article today [looking at the impact and future](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/07/metaverse-slow-death-facebook-losing-100bn-gamble-virtual-reality-mark-zuckerberg) of Meta’s Metaverse project. It is not a good read if you are holding Meta stock but I guess nothing really has been for the last few months. What I found most interesting in the article were the comments from Meta vice-president Vishal Shah trying to get his staff and developers to use their own VR software.

> “If we don’t love it, how can we expect our users to love it?” Shah wrote. “Everyone in this organisation should make it their mission to fall in love with Horizon Worlds. You can’t do that without using it. Get in there.”

## Eating your own dog food

If the people that create your products don't want to use them then you are in deep trouble. Far, far back in the misty depths of time, I worked for a company called DNA Multimedia. If was, and has been, the best workplace environment that I have had. The company did quite a few things but I worked with a set of artists and developers to create CD-ROM titles such as [The Silk Road](https://www.amazon.com/Silk-Road-DNA-Media-Inc/dp/1896631002/ref=sr_1_5?qid=1670439983&refinements=p_27%3ADNA+Media+Inc.&s=books&sr=1-5&text=DNA+Media+Inc.) and Paul Plimly's [Everything in Stages](https://www.isrbx.net/3137730601-paul-plimley-everything-in-stages-1996.html). 

[Steve Forth](https://www.ibbaka.com/ibbaka-about-us-people#executive), the head of the company, called us all into a meeting one day and asked us which CD-ROM products we view or used at home. There were various attempts made to excuse our own disinterest in the medium. He challenged us to explain how the market was going to be viable if we, the people making the products, didn't use them. 

One thing to know about DNA Multimedia was that they were producing award winning content. Design awards. Industry awards. They created the first enhanced music CD to be released in North America. They weren't creating shovel-ware junk CDs to try to lure in educational buyers. These were darned good products.

Steve was correct of course. The market for products like The Silk Road quickly evaporated and he saw that our lack of uptake on the products was a telling indicator of the strength of the market. 

## Why are you building it?

The Metaverse product from Meta seems to be a solution that is being created without any consideration for how it will be used and why it will be used. Typically the folks that build software products do so because they are interested in the field or the technology. Or you need a solution to a problem and one doesn't exist so you try to create it.  In either case you tend to be engaged. So what is happening with the Metaverse team? 

I think that the problem isn't with the coders and team leaders building the app. I suspect that the problem is at the top of the company hierarchy with a lack of vision. Meta isn't building a Metaverse environment because they have a belief in the category or the experience. They are building it to [save their asses](https://allpoetry.com/All-Things-will-Die). AOL died. CompuServe died. MySpace died. Twitter is dying.  The declension of failure stalks all tech companies. They know that at some point they will slip into irrelevance, be replaced and no longer be a going concern. 

The C suite that runs everyone's favourite surveillance system decided to be the farm on the Metaverse as a solution to this inevitable death. Like a villain from [a sci-fi novel or comic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-Humanite) uploading their mind into a new body Meta wants to build their own killer. And it seems like a pretty good idea. If you know the end is nigh then why not create your own demise, like some pyromaniac phoenix, and profit. 

## Step 3

It is all well and good to want to will something into existence but you need people to build it. And, in lieu of any dramatic changes in labour laws, to do that you need people who share your enthusiasm and have signed up for your monthly kool-aid subscription service. Billionaires not wanting to go broke isn't the compelling vision that Zuckerberg and Andreessen think it is. And without a vision or goal it is going to be difficult to get anyone interested in building it for you because they aren't creating anything. An escape chute to continued existence as a member of the 1% 

The other problem is that Zuckerberg is, to be blunt, full of shit when he talks about the Metaverse.

> “We’re a company that focuses on connecting people. While most other tech companies focus on how people interact with technology, we focus on building technology so people can interact with each other.”

They don't though. Meta built an ad serving and tracking system that has just enough features to keep people using the site. 

> A lot of the metaverse experience is going to be around being able to teleport from one experience to another. So being able to basically have your digital goods and your inventory and bring them from place to place, that’s going to be a big investment that people make.”

This is also pure BS. Facebook is a totally closed system. Why would they want to have goods and or services built in a Meta environment be usable somewhere else? 

> “The metaverse is not a single product or an operating system. It isn’t a single piece of cloth but a patchwork quilt. There won’t be a Meta-run metaverse, just as there isn’t a ‘Microsoft internet’ or ‘Google internet’ today. It won’t be ownable, just as today’s internet isn’t.”

Again, BS. For a large number of people the internet is Facebook. G+ tried to compete and failed. Yahoo Groups folded. Almost no-ones uses forums or other types of community building websites. 

It is difficult for a team, or teams, to build a product when your head won't be honest about what it is that they want. Control. Meta wants to control the future internet in the same way that Facebook does the current iteration. The Metaverse is just what Zuckerberg thinks the future is and so that is where he is pointing the company. 

## The future never is

People always want to know where their flying cars and jet boots are. They do this on their pocket-sized computers that connect to a worldwide network of other machines via wireless connections but whatever. Just like observing an electron will collapse its state, I have always thought that popular predictions of the future guarantee that they won't happen. Any prediction of a future state will always live in the past. And as the years go forward people look back at the predication and view it with quaint nostalgia.

Will the future of the internet be the Metaverse? Maybe it will, but I suspect that it will look nothing like what Meta is creating because their vision of it is already old. And had [a movie made about it](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677720/). Ever watch the 1995 movie [Hackers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/) and laugh about how they saw the future? 

The upcoming Metaverse will probably not look like any _one_ thing because it won't be made by _one_ company. It might be powered by Unreal or Unity. It might have 100 different "places" all powered by different tech but using an open standard for communication. Regardless of how it comes about it won't be something that a company like Meta will be able to force from the topdown.
