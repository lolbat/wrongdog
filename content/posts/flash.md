I finally got an opportunity to watch [The Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flash_(film)) and it is a troubling film. It wasn't the hot mess that I expected it to be but there wasn't enough good material in the film to justify watching it again [^1].

## The good

When the [Justice League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_League_(film)) movie was released I really struggled to understand the casting of [Ezra Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Miller). He was fidgety and seemed to be a version of the Flash that had mistaken ADHD meds for anti-depressants. After watching _The Flash_ I can see why they picked Miller for the role. The vision they had for the Flash was a character broken by the death of his mother and jailing of his father. He is subsequently a mess and Miller can do "hot mess" really well. You can see his do it quite well as [Trashcan Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Stand_characters#%22The_Trashcan_Man%22) in the recent reworking of _The Stand_ on TV. Understanding the casting isn't the same as liking it though.

[Kiersey Clemons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiersey_Clemons) is a treat as Iris West. She is portrayed unlike any other super-hero love interest I have yet to see and it is quite refreshing. 

[Michael Keaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Keaton) steals the show and it illustrates the gulf of talent that separates him from Ezra Miller. Miller is good in this movie [^2] but he doesn't have the experience that Keaton does nor the raw skill. I would watch a movie with Old Batman in a heartbeat. 

[Sasha Calle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasha_Calle) isn't really on screen long enough to judge her performance but I really did like the substitution of Kara for Kal-el in the film. I wouldn't object if her character made its way into another movie.

The entire third act of the movie is quite enjoyable. With one caveat that I will discuss in a bit. Original Barry and Batman interact well and they find Kara and then move to try to stop Zod from destroying the planet. The film works quite well when they travel to Russia to rescue Kara. It is very good super-hero cinema. Once the battle starts, Flashpoint Barry tries to figure out how to use his powers while Classic Barry tries to avert the disaster. Batman and Kara are used well and it is an enjoyable reprieve from all the damn talking that the two Barrys did in the second act. 

## The bad

Watching Miller be a total mess on the screen really isn't the study in character interpretation that it might have looked like prior to his ["troubles"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Miller#Controversies_and_legal_issues). The _Controversies and legal issues_ section of his Wikipedia page has had to be put into subsections to cover it all. It is painful to read and it is painful to watch Miller play some version of his own demons out on screen. 

This dynamic between the twitchy Barry Allen in the first act and the real Ezra Miller is off-putting. Miller also can't seem to wrap his head around how Flashpoint Barry is meant to act. He plays him as a bro-geek hybrid and isn't convincing. One could suggest that this might be caused by Miller not being able to associate with a character that has a childhood filled with love and easy living. Which is sad in and of itself. 

The second act of the movie is primarily filled with Miller acting off himself in scenes and so the energy is messy. Our "Earth One" Barry suddenly becomes far more capable than he was in the first act without any real explanation as to how. We have to watch Barry and Barry explore this new timeline and try to figure out what is different. This was, for me, the worst part of the film. It was entirely skippable and until Michael Keaton appears this part of the movie is just unwatchable.

And while I don't want to spoil it, the last scene (prior to the credits) has some of the worst acting in the movie overall as well as what has to be the worst green screen shot since the Quantumania movie. Erza Miller is meant to be standing in front of a courthouse and the lighting on him isn't even close to accurate for the scene. Lets not even talk about his acting in the scene. Mind you, the final scene was changed so often it is probably not really his fault that he wasn't able to give a convincing performance. 

The movie ends with a confusing montage of different Supermen and different multiverses. This wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't populated with very bad CGI stand-ins for various actors playing Superman. They make Grand Moff Tarkin from Rogue One look like a Da Vinci sculpture. This may be a result of scenes being added to the film at the last minute. _The Flash_ has been under the banner of three different management teams at the studio and everyone has wanted to make changes to have the film be their own. 

## Some other line from a movie title

The first act of the film establishes the premise and helps re-establish Barry's character in case we forgot it from the Justice League film. It has nothing to recommend it but it also isn't horrible. Except for the one scene with the coffee shop worker who is such a cliche of a gay man in his twenties that is borders on a hate crime. 

There are large parts of the movie that are unwatchable. These are mostly in the second act where Barry meets his Flashpoint self and they talk about... well they talk about a lot of things and it is pretty tedious. 

The Barry Allen character isn't consistent through the movie with the exception of the Earth Two Barry who does manage to follow a consistent path of character development. At the beginning of the movie, Barry is a ball of nerves and he gives the impression of being on the edge of violence at any point [^3].  The hate-crime stereotype in the coffee shop scene is less unbearable than Ezra Miller playing Barry as a man who appears to want to scream in response to the delay in getting his sandwich. He gives off this [Crispen Glover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crispin_Glover) vibe [^4]. 

Barry then suddenly becomes competent. He doesn't appear that capable when he is the Flash but his time travel and appearance in an alternate Earth makes him appear like the "after" part of a late-night TV life-management training course infomercial. This is one of the reasons why I have never liked the "on the spectrum" Barry Allen that has been developed since the _Justice League_ movie. It doesn't make any sense that someone so damaged and quirky could develop his powers and the tech he has made to build his Flash suit. And apparently the script writers agree as Earth One Barry has to drop the entire persona in order for the plot to move along. 

And it is a minor point buy apparently not many people online appear to have seen, or understood, the Whizz Comics reference in the film. Barry lives across the street from a store called Graysons but also across from _[Whizz Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiz_Comics)_ which is the book that originally featured Captain Marvel. If you are a feature writer for a website and you posted a "The Flash Easter Eggs" article that didn't include that then please delete your article. 

## Summing up

The movie really suffers from two problems. Ezra Miller isn't the best actor. Or at least he wasn't in a mental space to give his best performance. I find it difficult to believe that Miller wasn't this much of a wreck when he was given the part in _Justice League_ . And he had to have been when production started on the film. I know that many people see him as a villain but if he has had mental health issues then it strikes me that the people making these films did him no good by continuing to use him. As _The Flash_ shows us, there have been any number of folks that have played Batman and Superman so getting a new Flash wasn't out of the picture. 

And perhaps Miller's inclusion in the picture was also caused by the "too many cooks" issue that has plagued this film. Three different management teams have overseen the project (and the studio) and each new team has made changes to the film to bring it in line with their "vision". The ending of the movie is a mess. It is rushed and it looks it. Even seeing a faux Nicholas Cage as Superman wasn't as much fun as it could have been due to the poor nature of the effects. 

There is a decent movie hidden within _The Flash_ but it is difficult to see how it could have been reworked to bring it out. Ezra Miller really should have been recast. And someone at the studio apparently decided to try to take the spotlight from Flash and focus the ending on various Superman variants. When you combine it with all the different Batmen in the film it seems less like a Flash movie and more like a World's Finest trailer. 

[^1]: Or the first time for that matter. Unless you are a DC fan you can really just skip this movie.

[^2]:  Other than the scenes where he has to interact with himself. And, oddly for someone in as much legal troubles as he is, he doesn't seem to be able to act like an idiot. 

[^3]: That might just be my own reaction to people who act like that. I also thought that Crispen Glover in _Back to the Future_ was on the verge of murdering hsi family.

[^4]: Which makes the references to _Back to the Future_ later in the film a bit more interesting. Not a lot though.
