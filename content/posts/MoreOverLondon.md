{{< alignimg OverLondon.jpg left>}} I have finally wound my way to the end of [OverLondon](https://www.overlondon.net/) and have been happily surprised by the book. You can check out my initial comments in [this earlier post](/posts/overlondon/). OverLondon is a comic-fantasy novel [^1] where steampunk scientific advances and genetic variability have turned the historical Europe into a mad setting. OverLondon is a funny book but, as amusing as it is, the true joy of the book is just how well it is constructed.

All authors try to tell a story. Good authors are able to write that story but also guide the reader through it. They know when to answer the questions a reader will have and reveal those answers pages after the reader thinks of them. This is tricky enough in a normal story but it is even more difficult in a mystery. Penney and Johnson have a knack for navigating this and making the journey through their book seem more of a discovery than an exposition. This is something that is doubly important for a mystery. You want to see incongruities in the story that make you think about a solution to the crime but not have it so obvious that it spoils the story [^2].

OverLondon tells its story through several different characters and has a good habit of showing you events instead of informing you of them. Sometimes this means that you only see a character's POV for a chapter [^4] but it is a clever way to not only advance the story but also to provide the reader with clues in a more natural fashion.

The book has an abundance of interesting characters such as Slasher Harry, Vikram [^5], Gregor and a small cast of secondary characters who all seem as if they could have their own adventures on day. 

My only critique is not of the book itself but the lack of footnotes in it [^6]. This is certainly not the fault of the authors who did add them to the book. The villain is, as it often is these days, Amazon. Apparently the Amazon Kindle e-reader is unable to properly render them. Or it does such a poor job of it that it might as well not be able to. Apparently this was enough of a problem that Pratchett himself stopped using them in his books. It is clear, after finishing the book and also reading [_A Tourist's Guide to OverLondon_](https://www.overlondon.net/visitors-guide) that Penney and Johnson sprinkled amusing anecdotes and references throughout the novel only to have to remove them and put some of them into the text of the novel and also into _A Tourist's Guide to OverLondon_. Thanks a lot Amazon [^7].

 I really liked OverLondon. It is clearly a book inspired by Terry Pratchett but it also has its own sensibility and themes. It is coming out, in ebook format, [on September 12th](https://www.overlondon.net/overlondon) and I am lead to believe that there will be a print version coming out after that. I will certainly be picking it up if and when it does. 

[^1]: As with a lot of English terms it doesn't mean "swords and sorcery" as much as it means "fantastic".
[^2]: For a great example of this check out Battlefield Earth [^3].
[^3]: Actually don't. It is a horrible book.
[^4]: Until something horrible happens.
[^5]: Who may or may not be selling questionable books. 
[^6]: And not just because I like footnotes.
[^7]: Is there anything they can do correctly?
