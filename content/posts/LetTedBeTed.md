Season 2 of Ted Lasso was a total kick in the stomach for me. The travails that the writing room put Ted through as a way to explain his nature and outlook seemed totally unnecessary. At least to me. Writers don't seem to want to leave 'nice' characters alone. It is as if something about a balanced and happy character brings out the knives. 

Part of the problem seems to be that writers are told that good writers don't leave nice characters alone. Apparently leaving nice characters alone means [no conflict in your story](https://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/why-nice-characters-equal-no-conflict/). This seems more akin to torturing your Sims than writing advice but I'm not a TV writer so I might be missing something. It seems to be a cheap way to artificially create conflict or tension without... well without being a better writer.

It seemed as if Ted had enough conflict. His wife was estranged from him precisely because of his attitude and he was separated from his son. He had to try to learn a new sport and keep a team in the Premier League. Isn't that enough? Hell no! Lets drag suicide into the mix as well. Heaven forbid that they just have a happy go-lucky character be that way because they are just happy [^1]. 

This isn't a new problem. One of Lauren Graham's early roles was as Shelly in [Caroline in the City](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111910/). Her ebullience and happy attitude was in direct contrast to the character of her boyfriend, played by Malcolm Gets, but was explained by Shelly being utterly stupid. That she liked everyone, was mad for her boyfriend and was positive were all diminished under the glare of her lack of education and unforgivable lack of knowledge about Kandinsky.

### An aside

It isn't just writers that appear to no like nice characters. Sian Cain, writing in the Guardian [^2], appears to have gotten too much of Ted Lasso.

> Whether or not the unrelenting positivity of the show was to be admired, enjoyed, endured or ridiculed depended on who you spoke to. But as the episodes crept from 30 minutes to 40, then 70 minutes over three seasons, Ted Lasso became gratingly, ruthlessly, cynically, about demonstrating its niceness and not much else.

There are more examples that have been published but they all seem to share a common lack of interest in the core theme of the show. Mind you, the writers seem to share this disdain as well. 

## Succession

It seems like an interesting contrast to the plaudits that have fallen around Succession at its finale. I never watched the show because there are enough horrible people, and things, in the world and I really don't want to spend my time watching fictionalised versions of them. I am especially glad to have not watched it given [allegations of harassment and racism](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/lost-showrunners-racism-toxic-writers-room-damon-lindelof-1235628095/) that appear to have plagued another Damon Lindelof show - Lost. 

## Back to Ted

With the third season over, I feel comfortable enough trying to watch it given that I can skip anything traumatic and also jump to a new episode to see if any unwatchable situations resolve themselves. I am hoping that I won't need to do this.
