Mastodon is a an interesting mix of experiences. I have met a lot of interesting and fun people while using it. I have found new books to read and apps to use. And I have also had some interesting conversations with people that I wouldn't normally meet. It has been, all in all, a good experience.

## But

There is currently a debate on many Mastodon instances regarding the potential defederation of any sites that Facebook releases using their upcoming [Threads](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754304/instagram-meta-twitter-competitor-threads-activitypub) Twitter replacement. I was going to write some comments on the situation but this article does a far better job than I could [explaining the issues and the serious implications.](http://wok.oblomov.eu/tecnologia/credible-threat-1/).

There are people saying that we should all give Facebook the benefit of the doubt and wait and see what happens with their ActivityPub service and then defederate it if it turns into a shithole. Apparently these folks are unfamiliar with [Facebook's prior history](https://stopfb.uber.space/). Some [writers](https://daringfireball.net/) [who should know better](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site:daringfireball.net+Embrace+extend+extinguish&atb=v377-1&ia=web) are getting their knickers in a knot at the idea of admins proactively defederating any instance that Facebook.

## This sounds familiar

The tech term for this is "[Embrace - Extend - Extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace%2C_extend%2C_and_extinguish)" and it has been the modus operandi for big-tech for decades. Microsoft mastered this, and is potentially using it again with VS Code, and most big tech firms do it. Microsoft's activity with Internet Exploder and its subsequent court case wasn't seen as a warning to other tech firms but an example of how not to implement a 3E [^1] strategy.

Most tech companies have been so bloated with funds in the last few decades, and running at at ridiculous P/E ratios, that they haven't needed to try to use 3E. They just buy their competitors. The last major 3E play was the [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) standard which was adopted, and then killed, by Google and Facebook. For a brief while you could connect to almost any messaging system and chat with friends regardless of what app or service they were using. 

Clearly that couldn't last.

## Why we can't have nice things

Susan Sontag once said:

> 10 percent of any population is cruel, no matter what, and 10 percent is merciful, no matter what, and the remaining 80 percent can be moved in either direction.

She was reflecting on the experiences of the Holocaust and I don't mean to diminish that but her words have resonated with me for some time and I find them applicable in many circumstances. This is one of them. 

Facebook is run by a group of people that would probably trick out an elderly relative if they thought they could make a suitable return [^2]. Facebook is clearly a global cause of disorder and it isn't even a very good service. 10% of people will tell you that. 

The problem is the other 80% who just want things to be simple. And probably shiny. 

If you have [been around for long enough](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) you will have heard the arguments that people are currently making about Facebook and ActivityPub many, many times. The reason that the internet is in its current shape is precisely because of the same sort of BS that is currently being peddled regarding Facebook's Twitter replacement [^3]. 

The problem, and the reason why Facebook and Twitter even succeeded in the first place, is that the 80% really don't want to listen to reason. They want their shiny new toys and it doesn't matter what you say. And pointing out the historical track record of these companies is also pointless. 

If you want to know why MAGA folks are impossible to reason with you only have to look at the folks currently trying to tell everyone that Facebook won't use this new service to hoover all the ActivityPub users in and then shut the doors. It is the same dynamic. 

## So goodbye

So I am leaving Mastodon.

Not because I want to. And not because it hasn't been a vibrant community. It is because the 80% will fuck it all for everyone else. And this has happened to me so many times now that I really don't want to go through it again. I would rather do without a few good years of a service than watch the inevitable decline and death of it.

So long. It was fun. 


[^1]: Or we could add Enshittification and then make it 4E.
[^2]: They might pretend to be sad about it but their PR people would have a press release ready explaining why this was a necessary step. Their stock price would probably go up as a result. 
[^3]: Can we also talk about the lack of vision that this demonstrates? Using an existing protocol to duplicate an existing service?
