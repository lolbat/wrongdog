Social media is seen as the best way to connect with users who might want to engage with your content and your company. At least this is what the social media companies will tell you. As well as the ancillary companies that sell services to help you promote your content on social media.

For most companies there are two major problems with using social media. Social media is seen by an increasing amount of the population as [a problem and not a solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook) and consequently they don't use it. Social media sites also limit the unpaid reach of content on their platforms. Unless you are paying to expand your "reach" then your content may only reach 4-8% of the people that follow your company or product pages. If you have 1000 followers of a page you will be lucky if 100 of them will see your post. Facebook as [an extensive discussion](https://transparency.fb.com/features/ranking-and-content/) of the process that it uses to determine what content shows up on a user's feed. 

If you combine the people that aren't on social media with the number of fans you can't connect to via "organic reach" the supposed benefit of the size of social media platforms disappears. It doesn't matter if a site has a billion daily users if your content won't be seen by more than 100.

A second complication is that once you post content on a social media site you lose control of who can see it. Most social media sites will either block access to content unless a visitor is signed in or will disable access after a set time or a set number of interactions. That content will also not be indexed by Google or other search engines.

This leads to a situation where content is only viewable by a small number of people on a social media site unless you pay for expanded reach.

## Describing the process

This process is popularly known as [enshittification](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys). The author Cory Doctorow is the originator of the term and his essay explains the process at length [^1]. It can be simplified:

> first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves.

Social media sites are, for the most part, at the end of that cycle. They have lured in users, then used those users to lure in companies and advertisers. They are now trying to claw back as much value for themselves. One of the simplest ways to do that is restrict access to content. 

This isn't a new concept. Yahoo Groups was a web-based alternative to Usenet but it was an entirely closed system. You couldn't link to files, posts or even calendar entries unless the person visiting the site was also a member of your group and also logged in. Facebook, probably the largest social media site, is at this same stage. You can't see content on Facebook unless you are a Facebook member.

This makes sense from Facebook's perspective. They want to maximise the number of people who use their site and blocking off access to content is seen as a way to force people to sign up. I am not sure if it actually works and I am not aware of any studies that have examined the issue [^2]. 

## What to do?

So if you are a company that produces content to showcase your products what can you do to retain control over who can see your content but also leverage social media networks? The answer to the question is actually quite simple but the implementation of it is slightly more complex. 

### The simple part

The current term used to describe this solution is [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) - **P**ublish (on your) **O**wn **S**ite, **S**yndicate **E**lsewhere. The idea isn't new but there is a new movement underway, Indie Web, that has been working to popularise the acronym and also promote the concepts behind it. 

In a nutshell POSSE is using your own website or blog to publish content and then posting links to that content on social media. The full content resides on your site, under your control, and people on social media see the links and previews of the content in their feeds. People can still comment and react on their favourite social media site but the content is accessible to everyone. Even search engines.

### The less simple part

In the last two years most social media sites have made it more difficult to automate posting links to their platforms. Facebook blocked automated posting to your own feed  and only allows it on product or company Pages. X/Twitter has famously limited API access to their platform. 

In the past I used Wordpress and its social media tools to automate posting links to my blog posts on Facebook and Twitter. For the most part those automations no longer work. There are commercial sites that will do this for you as well as [free sites](https://brid.gy/). 

The most cost efficient and expedient process might be just posting the links into your social media sites manually. 

### The benefit

Using POSSE provides you with three benefits

1. You control access to your content
2. You control the URL used to access your content
3. You can edit and update your content and be assured that those changes will be seen over every platform

Odds are most companies already have a website they can use to follow this process. And if they are posting to social media they are probably already creating Open Graph and Twitter preview images. POSSE allows you to use those, use social media but maintain control.

[^1]: It is also a good read and quite funny in parts.

[^2]: Searching on the issue is a nightmare and almost no variation in terms leads one to articles that aren't about blocking social media sites in offices, schools or for children.
