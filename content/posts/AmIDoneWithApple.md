The first Mac that I ever used was a Macintosh SE that the Linguistics department had in a student accessible lab. It only had Illustrator '88 installed and was there for staff and students to use to make illustrations for papers and manuscripts. It was how I learned Illustrator and how I was able to land a job at a reprographics company later that year using Illustrator on an SE 30.

For the longest time I availed myself of machines that were available either at work or at student labs at the university. It wasn't until 1993 that I was able to buy a [Macintosh Quadra 610](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Quadra_610) and work at home. I quite literally wouldn't have had a career in design and layout without the Mac. I also am not sure if the software that powered the explosion of new design and typography in the 90s would even have been possible without the Macintosh.

Back then you could use apps like [ResEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResEdit) to change how to operating system and applications looked. You could even change the text in application dialogs if you wanted to. It was crazy. I once used ResEdit and another application to change the entire UI of a British Republican coworker's Mac to be a homage to the recently departed Princess Diana. He was furious. It was an awesome prank.

There were certainly issues with Macs at the time. They were slower than Intel PCs. No-one made games for them. Prior to Steve Jobs coming back and rescuing the company they made a series of bland hardware and spent a lot of time trying to fix the Mac OS which was truly showing its age by then. The company was run by a series of uninspiring CEOs that didn't seem to really understand the Mac and what it was for.

But even looking back at those days with my rose-coloured glasses removed, I think that the Macs I used and owned then felt more personal and also felt as if they were *my* computer. I tinkered with them. I changed settings. I installed whatever the hell I wanted. I am composing this on an M1 Macbook Air. It is very fast. It has quite a few very well crafted applications that I use on a daily basis. It doesn't seem as if this Mac is _my_ Mac. I can change the desktop picture. I can put some stickers on the lid of the laptop. But I feel as if I am missing an in herent part of owning a computer - the feeling that I can tweak and tinker to my heart's content and make the device truly mine.

## I accuse iOS

I don't think that this would be the case if it wasn't for iOS.

## It is my data isn't it?



## Yes, I do want to install that app
