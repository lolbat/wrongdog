Stephen King recently released a new novel [Holly](https://stephenking.com/works/novel/holly.html). I was curious about the novel but I found out that it was the fourth book in a series of crime novels that started with [Mr. Mercedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Mercedes) in 2014. Thanks to the wonder that is electronic publishing I got a copy and decided to give it a read.

I am not usually a fan of Stephen King. Not that he isn't a good writer. I am just not a fan of horror. Suspenseful scenes get under my skin and worm their way into my thoughts and I have a difficult time getting them out. I have yet to finish [House of Leaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Leaves) and the scene that stopped me in that book was the mildest of shocks [^1].

I have read some Stephen King. Mostly though, I have read various versions of [The Stand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stand#Publication_history) starting when I was in Germany in 1983. I don't know what it is about the book only that it compels me to reread it from time to time. 

While looking for the various novels in the series I discovered that there was [a TV version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Mercedes_(TV_series)) of the story that was released in 2017. There have been a lot of movies and TV shows [based on his work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adaptations_of_works_by_Stephen_King) [^2]. Some of them are [excellent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(film)) and some of them are [not so great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Tower_(2017_film)). As with many things, the results depend on the skill of the people doing the conversion but I am curious as to why directors and writers would even try to adapt a Stephen King work for TV or movies. 

## The internal voice

Stephen King puts you into the mind of the characters in his books. For better or worse. Ironically he uses the film-making methodology of "showing not telling" in his books. His characters are defined by their thoughts and the internal dialogue that propels them to their actions. Even [Cujo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cujo) is told by letting us hear the dog's confused and angry though processes. There [are exceptions to this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misery_(novel)) I think this is a defining characteristic of his storytelling.

In novel, _Mr. Mercedes_ opens with Augie Odenkirk getting in line at a job fair and being dismayed at the number of people already there at 3 am. We explore the situation from Augie's perspective and, because this is a novel, we are given a full tour of Augie's thoughts, dreams and hopes. We feel the scene from his thoughts.

And so when we finally meet the villain of the story we explore his motivations and neurosis by being exposed to them are we read. Early in the novel, Brady Hartsfield, is serving ice cream from an ice cream truck. He is filled with jealousy over on the of older kids and has racist and hateful thoughts about the others, 

> “Jerome’s feet are sockless in his moccasins, his ankles still green from cutting the ex-cop’s lawn. He’s got a big smile on his undeniably handsome face, and when he flashes it at his weekend dates, Brady just bets those girls drop their pants and hold out their arms. 

> Come on in, Jerry.”

He maintains and happy exterior though. He works hard to make sure that no-one thinks he is anything other than a happy and well-centred young man. 

So how do a writer and a director expose the viewers to the inner workings of the villain's mind? Filming the scene and using the words uttered by all of the characters would create not only a boring scene but also one that doesn't actually tell us anything about Brady. 

King "shows" us the mindset of the villain by showing us their thoughts. In a visual medium the writer and director need to come up with a means for us to infer this information without being told it. And this is where, I think, a lot of the adaptations of his work break down. 

## A tough row to hoe

Even Stephen King thinks that his work is difficult to film. When [talking about the movie adaptation](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stephen-king-shawshank-redemption_n_5877810) of _Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption_ he said:

> "I thought, 'Oh man, no chance they're going to make a movie out of this puppy. It's too talky. It's great, but it's too much talking,'" King said of Darabont's script.

The short story on which the movie is based not only has a lot of internal dialogue but actual dialogue. It works [^3] because [Frank Darabont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Darabont) understood the material and wrote an impressive screenplay but where he succeeded there are many failures. The Vulture wrote an article [ranking all of the Stephen King movies and TV projects](https://www.vulture.com/article/best-stephen-king-movies-ranked.html). And while I don't agree with all of them [^4], I do think that anything after #7 in their list is really worth watching.

Which in interesting since [Pet Cemetary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Sematary), [Needful Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needful_Things) and [Apt Pupil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apt_Pupil) [^5] are very good stories. Ultimately it is a testament to the skills of the writers and directors that have successfully adapted his work. 

I know I would never want to try and I wrote a screenplay for _American Psycho_.


[^1]: Actually, the entire concept of a house that has doors that lead to rooms that extend past the physical dimensions of the house causes my skin to roil. 

[^2]: Far more than I first thought. 

[^3]: I actually think that King underplays how well some of his dialogue is.

[^4]: [Maximum Overdrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_Overdrive) is the best movie ever!

[^5]: Maybe I have read more Stephen King than I think I have?
