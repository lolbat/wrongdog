A few days ago the Alberta NDP lost the provincial election to a party of social conservative extremists. The party is lead by Danielle Smith who once said that [smoking is good for you](https://pressprogress.ca/danielle-smith-claimed-smoking-cigarettes-had-positive-health-benefits/) called unvaccinated people "[the most discriminated against group](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/new-alberta-premier-says-unvaccinated-most-discriminated-against-group-after-swearing-in-1.6612767)" that she has seen in her lifetime and also [violated ethics guidelines](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-ethics-premier-danielle-smith-breached-conflict-of-interest-act-1.6847662) in trying to get an anti-vaxx preacher's charges dropped. Prior to the election being called, the Alberta NDP were ahead in the polls and looked as if they were going to easily have a majority win. And then they shot themselves in the foot.

The NDP in Alberta are not really progressives. The party is heavily influenced by the oil and gas industry and many party members and even candidates have worked in the industry [^1]. The party is also more to the right than the NDP in British Columbia due to the more conservative nature of the province. So when the Alberta NDP [won their surprise victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Alberta_general_election) in 2015 it should not have surprised anyone that the party spent time, energy and funds promoting oil and gas and not any renewable sources.

In 2019 they were beat by a recombined conservative block but the only thing they offered any progressive voters was a reassurance that they weren't Jason Kenney and his ilk. They lost. It wasn't a big surprise and I voted for the party primarily because I liked my local candidate. 

This latest election should have been theirs to win. [Danielle Smith ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Smith) is a trainwreck. She was partially responsible for the Alberta NDP win in 2015 and was, for the longest time, persona non grata in conservative circles. She managed to win the leadership of the UCP, after the lunatic right kicked out Jason Kenney, by being the anti-vaxx, anti-science, anti-everything candidate that those right-wingers wanted. She is demonstrably stupid. She seems incapable of not saying "the quiet part" out loud and she is utterly transparent in her far-right views. 

Jeremy Appel does a very good job outlining [why the Alberta NDP lost](https://theorchard.substack.com/p/sifting-through-the-wreckage-of-alberta). In a nutshell though, the party tried the same "woo voters from the right" plan that has failed miserably in the past in this country. And just like a group that has failed to read Santayana, the Alberta NDP decided to give the plan a try again. And lost. To a total pineapple of a politician. 

Hence my email to them.

> I just wanted to send along some thoughts regarding the recent election. In January Ms. Notley made the following comment [^2].

> _When asked if she thought the move would alienate her base, who favours moving away from oil and gas production to stop climate change, the NDP leader said she wasn't certain._

> _"Maybe, maybe not," she replied. "Not sure. It's hard to say."_

> In response to that I emailed you to wish you luck in the election because I assumed, at that point, that the NDP would lose. I have commented in the past that the Alberta NDP was the functional equivalent of the old PC party and each year the party works hard to continue that drift towards the right. 

> This election cycle I voted for the Green Party candidate. I think the party is a bit of a mess but I refuse to vote for supposed progressives that are turning into centrists in the hopes of pulling votes from centre-right voters. This never works. It didn't work in BC and it didn't work federally under Mulcair. 

> It won't work in Alberta either. 

> I know that some in the party are attempting to rebrand this election as a "win". That is pure BS. The UCP are a party of extremists lead by a corporate shill who isn't smart enough to tie her her own shoes without someone from the Fraser Institute helping her. 

> And you lost.

> In the past I have held my nose and voted NDP because I thought it would make a difference. It hasn't and it won't with your current policies. There is **no** way you will be able to win an election in this province by moving right. Why would progressives vote for a more sympathetic version of the same neoliberal agenda that the Liberals and the conservatives peddle?

> I know I won't and I will tell every halfway progressive person I know to avoid the party until such time as it actually has a progressive agenda. 

> Good luck. You'll need it. 

The best part about this is that the only people that will suffer from this are those that are going to find a worsening health care system and more neoliberal austerity economics. Notley won't suffer from this and nor will any of the folks that promoted this disaster.
