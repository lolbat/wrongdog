It has been a while since I posted anything here and that is almost entirely to do with being in the midst of an extensive bout of depression. For the last few weeks I have been quite unable to do anything other than walk the dog and play game after game of [Monster Train](https://www.themonstertrain.com/) and [Dominions 5](https://www.illwinter.com/dom5/). I have also read a few novels.

I have had a few ideas for articles to post as well as some updates and changes to add to the site but it has been an effort to do much else other than breath. On the upside, I have gotten much better at Monster Train. 

I do have some posts that I hope to get around to soon but I am making an effort to just let this current depressive state work its way out and not let myself get "moral" about it. Nothing makes depression worse than using it as an excuse for self-recrimination. 

## Python

I haven't been doing any Python coding in some time. I have this odd habit of just dropping projects and entire types of work with no warning. I just got up one morning and decided that I wasn't going to spend any time writing Python code anymore. I am not sure if this is a common side-effect of ADHD but this has happened to me a few times in the last few years. It isn't even the case of stopping one Python project and starting another but no longer having any interest in any Python projects. 

Very glad I spent all of that time finding the right Python IDE for me. 

## Some changes

There are a few new links on the Links page and I have also added a link in the sidebar to contact me via email. It is just an obfuscated mailto: link so I am hoping that it doesn't generate too many spammers. This blog is all static HTML and so there isn't any way for me to add a form to the site other than using a third party service and I have to assume that all of them will just hover any data I send with a form submission. 

There are a few other changes coming to the site. Mostly converting all of the code images from bitmaps into text. I am also looking at a better way to show the code on the page. So I have been looking into some CSS. Or I was...
