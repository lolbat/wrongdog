It is known that the push for the use of AI [^1] tools for design will lead to people losing jobs or losing freelance contracts. It is already happening and only the most clueless or willingly ignorant of AI boosters would disagree. AI is going to replace workers but [the issue is capitalism and not technology](https://jacobin.com/2023/03/ai-artificial-intelligence-art-chatgpt-jobs-capitalism).

## We've this this show before

If you have worked in the design and typography industry for any time at all this isn't really a new problem. Desktop computers replaced dedicated typographers working on [phototypesetting machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototypesetting). Designers were replaced with office staff who used clipart and [CorelDraw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CorelDRAW) to create forms and newsletters. 

Technology advances and creates the circumstances with which a business can do "the same job" for less money. And for the most part businesses do. If they don't they will most likely lose business to a different firm that will use the technology to undercut quality at the expense of price. 

Capitalism is really a race to the bottom held by people who typically aren't impacted by the effects of their decisions.

## It wasn't always like this

There are many examples available online of great design and typography that was created for banal items such as [Stationery payment allotment forms](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/280286), [post office forms](https://www.hipstamp.com/listing/norway-1930s-vintage-postal-form-parcel-post-service/5257202) and [catalogue order forms](https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/424182858634061061/).

Now lets not credit the businesses that created these for any altruistic values. These items were created by design professionals because industry had no other choice. There may have been business owners in the 30s in Europe and the US that might have chosen to continue to create forms or other business communications for aesthetic reasons but I suspect that the era of design and illustration that existed at the turn of the 20th century was due to a lack of cheaper alternatives and not because business felt moved by great art. 

## Faster Pussycat!

Part of the reason why AI is currently so much of a problem is the speed at which it can disrupt. MLM and LLM systems are not only rapidly increasing in quality but are removing the need for specialised user input. Time posted about ["prompt engineers" making 6 figures](https://time.com/6272103/ai-prompt-engineer-job/) and DALL-E 3 is [already removing the need for them](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23881241/openai-dalle-third-version-generative-ai). You can't even get a job working for the machine that is going to replace everyone else.

I have following some links on Hacker News the other day and ended up at the new Bing Image Creator. It uses the new DALL-E 3 engine and I decided to try it out and create an image. This is the result.

This took a bit more work than I would have liked but only because I couldn't find a way to get the Bing Image Creator to iterate over an existing image. There are problems with the image but it is much better than I could do on my own. 

Where it really becomes problematic, if you work as a designer for a living, is that the images can then be opened in Microsoft Designer. That program will then suggest layouts which you can then edit. The app will continue to offer suggestions based on the text you enter. You can iterate through design ideas quite quickly.

Now it isn't going to eat everyone's job's just yet. For some reason my prompt for 

> Create a realistic design of a bear carrying a birthday cake through a busy office. Add a festive touch to the design with balloons and confetti.

Lead to this image which is clearly not a bear.

Where the image generator in the Designer product failed, the Image Generator did a much better job but it missed out on the "realistic" prompt.

![A cartoon bear carrying a birthday cake through an office. There are balloons and confetti in the air. People are still working despite a very large bear being in close proximity to them. ](/images/bearWithCake.jpeg)

The bear looks good. I am not sure why it has a metal carrying case though. The people in the background all have the same "Jacob's Ladder" faces that occur through MLM generated art. 

## Fuck you. Pay me

I wouldn't use any of the art I created in a product. Most of it isn't good enough. And if I want to create a product I should either do the work myself or pay someone to do it. That seems to have been the social construct that has kept society going for the last few thousand years. Over time there has been the development of a new form of capitalism that I like to refer to as "Fuck you. Pay me! Capitalism".

It is defined by its attempts to get the most ROI from consumers with the least amount of up-front expense. Ideally, it would like to get the consumer, or government, to pay for those up-front costs as well. 

Does the online booking system you have to use, because the company that runs your doctor's office doesn't want to hire receptionists, not work? Fuck you. Pay me.

Is it impossible to follow the form you need to fill out to get government services? Fuck you. Pay me.

Does the company you bought an ebook from want to remove it from your device so you can never read it again? Fuck you. Pay me.

When I was younger, unions and progressives still talked about the [Living Wage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_wage). Most of the people in business and government who are actively working to push down wages and living conditions were beneficiaries of this concept. Business now wants to have nothing to do with this idea and is pushing for an odd dystopia where people still buy all of their products despite not having enough money to feed themselves because there are no jobs left.  Oh, and they also don't like the idea of [basic income programs](https://theconversation.com/basic-income-after-automation-thats-not-how-capitalism-works-65023).

## This is the life

AI is just the latest, and perhaps final, step in the process of business removing as many living workers as it can from its payroll. Living workers have demands. They want more money. They need dental plans and medical care. They want holidays. All of which cut into the glorious task of increasing shareholder value.

I say that this might be the final step as it strikes me as the last cut that business can make before it hits an artery and bleeds out. There is no where to go after this [^2]. Modern capitalism has been racing for this moment but never thinking about what happens when it hits rock bottom. This is hardly surprising since most businesses are run by folks who view a quarterly report as an epoch away and haven't had a forward looking thought since they joined the C suite. 

At least someone will be able to make an amusing birthday card for the two or three co-workers they still have left in the office. 

[^1]: I have given up trying to not use the term AI to describe MLM amd LLM systems. Most people don't know what I mean when I use them in conversations. 

[^2]: Or at least nowhere I would want to imagine.
