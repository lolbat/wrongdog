Last month I purchased a Bluetooth speaker to use around the house so I could play music while I worked. We have a very old CD player in the kitchen but the speakers are showing their age and sound rather muffled. It is also not very portable and so a new electronic doodad was purchased. I bought it at Best Buy which is a Canadian electronics chain store. I spent quite a bit of time looking for a locally owned store that sold them but wasn't able to find one. As part of the purchase I also received three months of free Apple services - TV+, Music, Arcade and [News](https://www.apple.com/apple-news/). 

I used to spend quite a lot of time reading magazines and newspapers. When I lived in Vancouver the neighbourhood I lived in had a wonderful store that carried a vast number of magazines and papers from around the world. If you got in early enough you could get a copy of the Times. It carried British Football Weekly which became my Saturday morning read of choice. It was, for a student with a bit of money and a lot of free time, a mecca. I would go out on Saturday and Sunday morning to get something to read and then spend my morning and early afternoon at Cafe Abruzzo reading and drinking very strong Italian coffee and watching football [^1]. 

Now I know that the publishing industry has had dramatic changes since I was in university. I've had several long discussions with my family about why it has happened but it wasn't until I started browsing through the News application that I came to realise how those changes have impacted the type of news and content that gets produced. 

When you first open the News application you are presented with a selection of, what I hope are, default news sources. They are, for the most part, celebrity news, location specific news and a large amount of articles suggested from what would have been referred to, a few years ago, as content farms. Listicles, content that is primarily ads for video games or streaming services and various takes on popular movies and television shows. It is mind-numbing. Actual magazine racks are just as bad. National Geographic has more cover stories about Jesus than anything and Scientific American has been dumbed down to the point that it isn't any better than any other science magazine on the shelves.

I have managed to make the application more usable by following some of the periodicals I am interested in but Apple still tries to push its own idea of appropriate content into these feeds marked with a small Apple News icon. While it is not as pernicious as the suggestions on YouTube these articles seem to follow the same rules in that they are being chosen for their popularity and not because they actually fit into my reading habits. You can disable this which makes me think that someone on the development team knew that the suggestions would annoy the hell out of people.

The situation is certainly caused by Apple trying to push what it views as "popular" content at you. I can't imagine that there is any human moderation involved in the Top Stories or Suggested For You sections of the application. So Apple does push content at me but it isn't responsible for the waves of nearly identical marshmallow fluff that gets produced. 

There are publications and sites that produce content that is unique, important and interesting. They are either heavily dependent on subscriptions or have financial backing to help them survive. The rest seem to have built a business model around hoping that their generic listicle about the ten things wrong with a popular character from a current show or movie will show up high enough in a search result to bring a reader to their site and then hope they stay long enough to see some ads. 

Engagement and traffic stats have been slowly destroying the desire for online news and magazine sites to create unique work. In Canada, the CBC News website underwent a series of changes based on a desire to increase traffic and engagement. It is now filled with more human interest stories than news and Reddit is a better source of actual Canadian news. The CBC News website has three different ad systems and nine trackers that it loads when you visit it. This is a much lower number than in previous years but still a remarkable number for an organization that gets all of its funding from the government. CNN.com loads 39 ad and tracker payloads which is far more than People.com loads (16).

There is a lot of time and effort being spent to get you to come to a website, track you while you are there and open bids for ads that are based on data about you from other sites. And all of it seems to create content that is no different than on any other sites. Maybe the listicle has seven items instead of ten. Maybe the hot take on the actors from Doctor Who is slightly more negative. Or the suggestions for how to clear your cluttered office space are written with examples from a different star who has a movie being released.

The root cause is that not many sites appear to be interested in anything other than capturing market share and making money. Maybe they have VC investors pushing them to make more cash so they can divest and cash out? It seems as if it is an inherently flawed business model. If you don't create content that makes you stand out from the pack then what do you offer readers that your competition doesn't have? 

Perhaps a scrolling interface that makes your undifferentiated content flow like a Twitter timeline?
